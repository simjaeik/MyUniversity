windows  tiles  missing  from its and ivy over once a and easily the largest and 1
grandest  building  for miles the riddle house was now and  the little hagletons 1
all  agreed  that  the  old  house  was  half  strange and horrible had happened 1
something  that  the  older of  liked to discuss when topics for gossip were the 1
story so and had been embroidered in so many that nobody was quite the was every 2
version  of  the  started  in the same fifty years at daybreak on a fine morning 1
when  the  riddle  house  had still been  a maid had entered the drawing room to 1
find all three the maid had run screaming down the hill into the village

village there with their eyes wide cold as still in their dinner the police were 2
and  the  whole  of little hangleton had with  curiosity and nobody wasted their 1
breath  pretending  to  feel about the for they had been most elderly and riddle 1
had been  and and their had if all the villagers cared about was the identity of 2
their  murderer  three  did  not all drop dead of natural causes on the same the 1
hanged  the  village  did  a  roaring trade that the whole to have turned out to 1
discuss  the  they  were  rewarded for their  cook arrived dramatically in their 1
midst  and  announced  to a  man called frank bryce had just been cried several 1
rank  bryce  was  the he lived alone in a cottage on the of the riddle frank had 1
come  back from the war with a very crowds and loud and had been working for the 1
riddles  ever  there  was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more thought he 1
was she told the eagerly listening after her sure if offered him a cuppa offered 2
it a hundred never wanted to he said a woman at the had a hard he likes the quiet 1
quiet o reason to else had a key to the back barked the been a spare key hanging 2
in the cottage far back as i can nobody forced the no broken all frank had to do 2
was creep up to the big house

right grunted turned him if you ask said the you i like to get on the wrong side 2
of  said  an  excited  woman in the  said nodding when he was a by the following 1
hardly  anyone  in  little  hangleton  doubted  that  killed the but over in the 1
neighboring town of great in the dark and frank was stubbornly again and that he 2
was  and that the he had seen near the house on the day of the deaths had a  and 1
nobody  else  in  the village had seen any such and sure frank had invented just 1
when  things  were looking very serious for the report on came back and changed 1
he  police had never read an odder a team of doctors had the concluded that none 1
of the riddles had been or far as they could harmed at in fact report in a tone 1
tone  he  riddles  all  appeared  to  be  in perfet health from the fact all the 1
doctors  did  note  though  determined  to find something wrong that each of the 1
riddles  had  a  look of terror upon his or  whoever heard of three people being 1
frightened  to  as  there was no proof that the riddles had been murdered at to 1
frank  the riddles were buried in the little hangleton  objects of curiosity for 1
a to and amid a cloud of bryce returned to his cottage on the grounds of the far 2
as  he  killed  and  i care what the police said dot in the hanged if he had any 1
leave  knowing  as  how we knows he did  but frank did not he stayed to tend the 1
garden  for  the riddle and then the next neither family stayed perhaps it frank 1
that  the  new  owners  said  there was a nasty feeling started to fall into the 1
wealthy  man  who  owned  the  riddle  house these days neither they said in the 1
village  that  he  kept  it  for  though  nobody   these might the wealthy owner 1
continued to pay frank to do was nearing his seventh birthday very his bad leg stiffer 1
stiffer e seen pottering around the flower beds in fine even though  creep up on 2
try as he might to suppress weeds were not the only things frank had to contend with 1
with  a  habit  of  throwing  stones through the windows of the riddle  over the 1
lawns  frank worked so hard to keep once or they  house for a they knew that old 1
devotion  to  the  house almost to an and it amused them to see him limping the 1
stick  and  yelling croakily at for his believed the boys like their parents and 1
though him a so when frank awoke  in august and saw something very odd up at the 2
old he the gone one step further in their attempts to punish it was bad leg that 2
woke  it  was  paining  him  worse  than  ever up and limped downstairs into the 1
kitchen  with  the  idea  of his stiffness in his standing at the filling the he 1
looked  up   saw  lights  glimmering in its upper frank knew at once  had broken 1
into  the  house and judging by the flickering quality started a frank had no in 1
any  he  had deeply mistrusted the police taken him in for questioning about the 1
he  put  down  the   back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would and was soon and 1
removing  a rusty old key from its hook by the he picked was propped against the 1
and set off into the  the front door of the riddle house bore no sign of being of 1
of  rank limped around to the back of the house until he reached by took out the 1
old  put it into the and opened the door he let himself into the cavernous frank 1
had  not  entered although it was very he remembered where the door into  groped 1
his  way  towards  his nostrils full of the smell of footsteps or voices from he 1
reached  the  which  was  a little large mullioned windows on either side of the 1
front  and  to  the  dust  that lay thick upon the because it muffled the on the 1
frank turned and saw at once where the intruders of the passage a door stood and 2
a  flickering  light  shone through  of gold across the black frank edged closer 1
and  he  was  the  room  the  he now had been lit in the this surprised then and 1
listened  for  a voice spoke within the it sounded timid is a little more in the 1
my  if  you are still said a second this too belonged to a man it was strangely 1
nd  cold  as a sudden blast of icy something about that on back of neck stand me 1
closer  to  the   frank turned his right ear toward the the better to came being 1
put  down  upon  some hard and then the dull scraping noise a dragged across the 1
frank  caught a glimpse of a small his to chair into he was wearing a long black 1
and there was then he went out of sight is said the cold my said the first voice 2
set out to explore the i

i will milk her before we said the second will need  the the journey has tired me 1
me  brow frank inclined his good ear still closer to the  was a and then the man 1
called wormtail spoke may i ask how long we are going to stay  said the cold the 2
place  is  moderately  and  the  plan  cannot proceed it would be foolish to act 1
before  the  frank  inserted  a  gnarled finger into his ear and rotated  he had 1
heard  the  word  which was not a word at quidditch world my said dug his finger 1
still  more  vigorously into his but do not understand should we wait the  world 1
cup  is  at  this  very  moment  wizards  are pouring into the country and every 1
meddler  from the ministry of magic will be on on ususual checking and they will 1
be obsessed with lest the muggles notice so we frank stopped trying to clear out 2
his  he  had  distinctly heard and each of these expressions meant something and 1
frank  could  think of only two sorts of people who  frank tightened his hold on 1
his  walking stick once and more lordship is still wormtail said iam there was a 1
note  of  menace in the cold voice aslight pause followed the wormtail the words 1
tumbling  from  him   though  he was forcing himself to say this before he lost 1
ould be done without harry my another more and then  harry breathed the second voice 1
voice  do  not say this out of concern for the said his voice  boy is nothing to 1
nothing  at  it  is merely that if we were witch or wizard wizard thing could be 1
done so much more if to leave you for a short while know that i can disguise myself 1
myself  ack  here  in  as  little  as  two days with a suitable person could use 1
another said the cold voice is it makes said sounding thoroughly relieved hands 1
hands  n harry potter would be so he is so well protected so you volunteer to go 1
and  fetch  me a i perhaps the me has become wearisome for could this suggestion 1
of the be nothing more than an attempt to desert ihave no wish to leave none at all 1
all  not  lie  to hissed the second can always you are regretting  that you ever 1
returned to i revolt i see you flinch when you touch  my devotion to your lordship 1
lordship  evotion is nothing more than you would not be here if else to how am i 1
to survive without when i need feeding few

few  you  seem  so  much  my lord breathed the second am no and a few days alone 1
would  be to rob me of the little health i have regained under your who had been 1
sputtering  fell  silent  at for a few frank could hear nothing but the fire the 1
the  second  man  spoke once in was almost a  have my reasons for using the as i 1
have  already  to  and  ihave waited thirteen a few more months will make no as 1
rotection  surrounding  the  i  believe  my plan will be all that a courage from 1
wormtail  you  will  unless you wish to feel the  lord wrath imust said panic in 1
his  voice  through  our  journey  i  have  gone over the plan in my head bertha 1
disappearance  not   unnoticed for and if we if i murder whispered the second if 1
you  follow the the ministry need never know that anyone else has you will do it 1
quietly  i  could do it but in my present one more death and our to harry potter 1
is  i  am  not  asking  you  to do it by have rejoined us am a faithful said the 1
merest  trace  of  sullenness  in ineed somebody with somebody whose loyalty has 1
never and fulfill neither  found said and there was definitely a sulky edge to his 1
his he one who found i brought you bertha  is said the second sounding stroke of 2
brilliance i would thought possible from wormtail if truth be you were not aware 1
aware  he  would  be  when you caught were thought she might be my lord said the 1
second  voice  the  cruel  amusement  more pronounced than ido not deny that her 1
information  was  without  i  could formed our and for you will have your i will 1
allow you an essential task for one that many of my followers would

would my what wormtail sounded terrified you want me to spoil the your part will 2
come  at  the  but  i  promise  you  will  have the honor of being just as voice 1
suddenly  sounded as though his mouth had gone very are to kill me said the cold 1
voice  would  i kill i killed bertha because i had she was fit for nothing after 1
my quite in awkward questions would have been asked if she had gone that she had 2
met you on her wizards who are supposed to run into ministry of magic witches at 2
wayside  wormtail  muttered  something so quietly that frank could not man laugh 1
entirely mirthless cold as his could have modified her but memory charms can be broken 1
broken  s  i proved when i questioned it would be an insult to her information i 1
extracted  from  out  in  the  frank  suddenly  became  aware that the hand his 1
slippery  with  the  man  with  the  cold  voice had killed  without any kind of 1
remorse  he  was dangerous and he was planning more murders harry whoever he was 1
in  danger frank knew what he must if was the time to go to the out of the house 1
and  head  straight  for  the telephone box speaking and frank remained where he 1
frozen to the with  more my faithful servant at harry potter is as good as it is 2
there  will be no more but i think i hear and the second voice he started making 1
noises such as frank  he was hissing and spitting without drawing frank thought he 1
he ome sort of fit or  and then frank heard movement behind him in the dark he to 1
to  found  himself  paralyzed with something was slithering toward him along the 1
dark  corridor sliver of he realized with a thrill of terror that it was a frank 1
stared  as  its undulating body cut a curving track the thick dust on the coming 1
closer  and closer was he to the  escape was into the room where the two men sat 1
plotting  yet  the  snake  would  surely kill him but before he had made his the 1
snake was level with and it was it was following the hissing noises made by the 1
the eyond the and in the tip of its tail had vanished

vanished  there was sweat on forehead and the hand on the walking inside the the 1
cold  voice  was  continuing to and frank was impossible this man could talk to 1
frank understand what was going he wanted more than anything to bed with his the 2
problem  was  that  his  legs  seem to want to stood there shaking and trying to 1
master the cold voice to

to has interesting it my said  said the to there is an old muggle standing right 1
right  utside  this listening to every word we frank have a chance to hide there 1
were  footsteps and then the  was flung wide abalding man with graying a pointed 1
and  watery  eyes stood amixture of fear and alarm in his him where are your the 1
cold  voice was coming from the ancient armchair before the the the on the other 1
was  curled  up  on  the  rotting  hearth   horrible  travesty of a pet wormtail 1
beckoned  frank  into  the  though  still  deeply frank on his walking stick and 1
limped  over the the fire was the only source of light in the it cast upon frank 1
stared  at  the  back  of the the man inside it seemed to for frank even see the 1
back  of  his  heard  said  the cold that calling said frank for now that he was 1
inside the now that the time had come for some sort of he felt

felt am calling you a said the voice means that you are not a know what you mean 2
by  said  his voice growing i know is heard enough to interest the police i done 1
murder and planning and tell youthis he on a sudden wife knows  up and if i come 2
back  have  no said te cold very knows you are you told  nobody that you were do 1
not lie to lord for he he always

always  that  said frank is i think much of your my turn and face me like a why 1
am  not  a said the cold barely audible now over the of  the am much more than a 1
why i will face come turn my chair the servant gave a eard with his face screwed 2
as though he would rather have done than his master and the hearth rug where the 2
snake the small man and turn the the snake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed 1
hissed nagged on its and then the chair was facing and he saw what was sitting in 1
in o the floor with a he opened his mouth and let out a  that he never heard the 2
words  the  thing  in  the  chair as green a rushing and frank bryce he was dead 1
before  he  hit   two  hundred  miles  the  boy called harry potter woke with a 1
chapter two  the scar harry lay flat on his breathing hard as though he had been 1
been vivid dream with his hands pressed over his the old scar shaped like a bolt 2
of  was  burning  beneath  his  fingers as pressed a wire to his he sat one hand 1
still  on  his  the other hand reaching which were on the bedside he put them on 1
and his bedroom amisty orange light that was filtering through the the

the  harry ran his fingers over the scar it was still he turned scrambled out of 1
crossed  the  opened  his  and  peered  into  the  inside of the a skinny boy of 1
fourteen looked back at his under his untidy black he examined the scar of his reflection 1
reflection  looked  but  it  was  still  harry  tried to recall what he had been 1
dreaming about before there had been two people he knew and one he concentrated 1
concentrated rying to the dim picture of a darkened room came to there had been a 1
a mall man called nicknamed and a high the voice of lord harry felt as though an 2
ice  cube  had  slipped  down  into  his he closed his eyes tightly and tried to 1
remember  what had but all harry knew was that at the moment when chair had  and 1
had seen what was sitting in he had felt a spasm of or had that been the pain in 2
his and who had the old man for there had definitely been him fall to the it was 2
all becoming harry put his face out his trying to hold on to the picture of that 2
dimly  lit  keep  water  in  his  cupped  the  details were now trickling as  to 1
voldemort and wormtail had been talking about someone  ry could not remember the 2
and  they had been plotting harry took his face out of his opened his and stared 1
around  his expecting to see something unusual as it there was an number unusual 1
things  in  this  a  large wooden trunk stood open a black and assorted rolls of 1
parchment littered that part of his desk that was not taken up by the empty cage 2
in  which  usually  on the floor beside his bed a book lay harry had fell asleep 1
last  the  pictures  in  this  book  were all men zooming in and out of sight on 1
throwing a red ball to  harry walked over to the picked it and watched on of the 2
a   goal  by  putting  the ball through a then he snapped the book quidditch the 1
best sport in the world distract him at he placed flying with the cannons on his 2
bedside crossed to the curtains to survey the street privet drive looked exactly 2
as  a  respectable suburban street early hours of saturday all the curtains were 1
as  far  the there a living creature in not even a and and harry went restlessly 1
back  to  the  bed and sat down on over his scar it the pain that bothered harry 1
was  no stranger he had lost all the bones from his right arm once and had  same 1
arm  had  been pierced by a venemous fang not long only ry had fallen fifty feet 1
from  an  airborn  he was used to they were unavoidable if you attended hogwarts 1
school  of  and  and  knack for attracting a lot of the thing that was bothering 1
harry was the last time his cause voldemort had been close but voldemort be the idea 1
idea  mort  lurking  in  privet drive was  harry listened closely to the silence 1
around  was  he  half   stair  or the swish of a and then he jumped slightly as 1
tremendous  grunting  snore from the next harry shook himself he was being there 1
was no one in the except uncle aunt and and they were plainly still their dreams 1
dreams ntroubled and  asleep was the way harry liked the dursleys it as though any 1
any o him uncle aunt and dudley were only living they were muggles who hated and 2
despised  magic  in  any  which  meant   welcome  in their house as dry they had 1
explained  away  over the last three years by telling everyone that he went  bly 1
criminal  they knew perfectly well as an underage harry to use magic outside but 1
they  were still apt to blame him about the harry had never been able to confide 1
in  them  in  the  wizarding  the  very idea of going to them when they his scar 1
hurting and about his worries about was and yet it was because of voldemort that 2
harry  had  to   if  it been for harry would not have had the lightning on if it 1
been  for  harry  would still have had  harry had been a year old the night that 1
voldemort  for awizard who had been gaining power steadily for eleven killed his 1
father  and  voldemort  had then turned his wand curse that had disposed of many 1
witches  and wizards in his to it had not instead of killing the small the curse 1
had upon harry had survived with nothing but a shaped cut on his and  demort had 2
been  reduced  to  something  barely  his powers his voldemort had the terror in 1
which  the  secret  community of and had lived for so long had followers had and 1
harry  potter had ome  it had been enough of a shock for harry to on his that it 1
had  been  even more disconcerting to find out that in  world knew his harry had 1
arrived  at hogwarts to find that lowed him wherever he but he was used to it at 1
the end  starting his fourth year at and harry was already the back at the castle 1
castle  ut  there  was still a fortnight to go before he went back to around his 1
room  and his eye paused on the birthday cards at the end of what would they say 1
if harry wrote to

to  at  hermione  voice  seemed  to  fill  his  shrill  and scar really write to 1
professor and go and  check common magical ailments and maybe something in there 2
about

about that would be go straight to the headmaster of and in the  consult a harry 2
stared  out of the window at the inky very much whether a book could help him as 1
far  as  he  he  was  to have survived a curse like it was highly that he would 1
ymptoms  listed  in  common  magical ailments and as for informing  harry had no 1
idea  where  dumbledore  went  during the summer  picturing with his long silver 1
full length and pointed stretched out on a beach rubbing suntan lotion onto his 1
his  ever  dumbledore  harry was sure that hedwig would be able to owl had never 1
yet failed to deliver a letter to even without

without  dear  professor  sorry to bother but my scar hurt this yours harry even 1
inside  his head the words sounded and so he tried to imagine his other best ron 1
and in a red hair and freckled face seemed to swim before a

a  scar  but  be near you can i mean be trying to do you in i maybe curse  scars 1
always twinge a ask  weasley was a fully qualified wizard who worked in the misuse 1
misuse  ice at the ministry of but he have any particular in far as harry in any 1
harry  like  the  idea  of  the whole that was getting jumpy about a few weasley 1
would  fuss  worse   than and fred and twin might think harry was losing his the 1
weasleys  were  favorite  family in the he was might invite him to stay any time 1
now had mentioned the and he somehow want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries 1
inquiries  arry  kneaded his forehead with his what he really wanted it shameful 1
to  admit  it  to was someone like like a an advice he could ask without feeling 1
someone  who  cared  about who rience with dark and then the solution came to it 1
was  so and so that had taken so long harry leapt up from the hurried across the 1
and  sat at piece of parchment toward loaded his quill with wrote dear wondering 1
how  best  to  phrase his still marveling at the  thought of sirius straight but 1
perhaps  it  so  surprising  found out that sirius was his godfather two months 1
here  was  a  simple  reason for complete absence from life then had been in the 1
terrifying  wizard  jail  guarded  by  called  fiends who had come to search for 1
sirius at hogwarts when he rius had been innocent murders for which he had been had 1
had  hom  nearly  everybody  now  believed  and hermione knew they had come with 1
wormtail  only  the though only professor dumbledore had believed their  for one 1
glorious  harry had believed that he was the at rius had offered him a home once 1
his name had been but the  away from him had escaped before they could take him 1
him  irius  had had to flee for his harry had helped him on and since sirius had 1
been  on the the home harry might if  tail had not escaped had been haunting him 1
all  it  dursleys knowing that he had so nearly escaped them  sirius had been of 1
some  help  to  even  if he be with it  due to sirius that harry now had all his 1
school  things never allowed this their general wish of keeping harry as as with 1
their  fear  of his had led them to lock his school in stairs every summer prior 1
to but their attitude had changed harry had a dangerous murderer for a godfather 2
harry  had  to   them that sirius was harry had received two letters from sirius 1
since  he  had at been not by owls was usual with but by brightly colored hedwig 1
had  not approved of these flashy she had been them to drink from her water tray 1
before flying off on the they put him in mind of palm trees and white and he was 1
was ever in case the letters were he was enjoying harry found it hard to imaging 2
dementors  surviving  for  long  in  that  sirius had gone which were now hidden 1
beneath  the  highly floorboards under sounded and in both of them he had harry 1
all  on  him  if  ever  harry  needed he needed to right all lamp seemed to grow 1
dimmer  as  the  cold gray light that into the when the sun had when his bedroom 1
walls  had  turned  when  sounds  of  movement could be heard from uncle vernon 1
leared  his  desk of crumpled pieces of parchment and reread his dear thanks for 1
your  last  that  bird was it could hardly get things are the same as usual diet 1
going  too  my aunt gling doughnuts into his room they told him have to cut his 1
keeps doing so he got really angry and chucked his out of computer thing you can 2

opened his drobe once without glancing at his reflection he started to o chapter 2

the  summer  with  uncle  vernon  and  aunt petunia had managed to find excuses 1
etunia  always  insisted  that  dudley  was  a very gifted boy whose while uncle 1
vernon  maintained  that  want  some  swotty  little  they  also skated over the 1
accusations  of  bullying  in  the  a but he hurt a aunt petunia had said at the 1
bottom  of  the  report there were a few comments from nurse that not even uncle 1
vernon  and  aunt  petunia could no aunt petunia wailed that dudley was and that 1

with  tables  and  the sorts of things that uncle vernon called to about it aunt 1
petunia had insisted that the whole family grapefruit quarter to he noticed that 2
it  was a lot smaller seemed to feet that the best way to keep up morale was get 1
more  to eat than but aunt petunia know what was hidden under the loose she idea 1
that  harry was not following the diet at the moment he  was expected to survive 1
the  summer  on  carrot  harry  had  sent to pleas for and they had risen to the 1
occasion  hedwig  had from  house with a large box stuffed full of parents were 1
he  hogwarts had obliged with a sack full of his own touched he had had too much 1
experience  of  had sent the family with an enormous fruitcake and meat poor who 1

while his mother was occupied with the of

and  the  sound  of  ripping  paper came aunt petunia set the teapot down on the 1
table and looked to vernon had got she have to wait long to find after a looked 1
looked  e  barked at the living  wondering what on earth he was supposed to have 1
done  this   and  followed uncle vernon out of the kitchen and into door sharply 1
behind  both  of  he marching over to the fireplace and turning to face harry to 1
pronounce him under harry would have dearly loved to have but he feel that uncle 1
uncle  emper should be tested this early in the especially when strain from lack 1
of  he  therefore  settled  for looking just said uncle he brandished a piece of 1
purple writing paper bout  confusion who would be writing to uncle vernon about who 1

but  next moment harry had begun to spin very and  room was whipped out of sight 1
in  a  rush  of  chapter five wizard wheezes harry spun faster and elbows tucked 1
tightly to his blurred until he started to feel sick and closed his when at last 1
last e threw out his hands and came to a halt in time to from ward out of the kitchen 1

version  of   breaking  and fond of bossing everyone bill was was no other it he 1
was  with long hair that he had tied back in a ring with what looked like a fang 1
dangling from clothes not place at a rock except that harry recognized his boots 2

sprinted across the yard lington boots that lay scattered around the harry could 2
hear crookshanks inserted a paw into the trying to reach a noise was coming from 2

charlie both had and two battered old tables fly high above the smashing into each 1
each  nock  the out of the fred and george were ginny was and mione was hovering 1
near the apparently torn between amusement and table caught with a huge bang and 2
knocked one of its legs  ter from and they all looked up to see head poking out of 1

slammed the window bill and charlie directed the tables safely onto the end to and 1
and  bill  reattached  the table leg and conjured tablecloths from  by seven the 1
two  tables  were  groaning  under  dishes  and  dishes cellent and the nine and 1
hermione  were  settling  themselves  to  eat beneath a to somebody who had been 1
living  on  meals  stale cake all this was and at harry listened rather than as 1

to  find  members  of other departments as you got ganize right after the world 1
percy cleared his throat significantly and looked down toward  and hermione were 2

stood  in  the i at  camp much poor got he picked up the dusty kettle and peered 1
inside  need  atap marked on this map the muggle gave said who had side the tent 1

having a i suppose here and there adult wizards and witches were emerging from to 1
to  ith  furtive  looks around conjured fires with their others striking matches 1
with  dubious  looks  on their as though sure  can wizards sat in serious all of 1
them  wearing long and looked like a rabbit on a bright purple while a group of 1
gossiping happily beneath a spangled banner stretched between salem harry caught 2
snatches of conversation in strange from the inside of tents they and though he understand 1

holding the harry noticed that he seemed he was slightly and distinctly but when 2
name was the whole stadium gave him a earsplitting and then came the irish aidan 2
lynch  was  being  supported  second crash seemed to have dazed him and his eyes 1
looked  but  happily as troy and quigley lifted the cup into the air  hands were 1
numb  with  at when the irish team had left the box to perform another lap lynch 1

leprechauns  kept  shooting over their cackling  their when they finally reached 1
the  nobody  felt  like  sleeping level of noise around weasley agreed that they 1
could  all  have   gether  before turning they were soon arguing enjoyably drawn 1
into  a  disagreement  about cobbing with and it was right at the tiny table and 1
spilled  hot chocolate all over the verbal replays and insisted that everyone go 1
to hermione and and harry and the rest of the weasleys changed into and from the 2
other side of the campsite they could still hear

to  stop  who was on a top bunk above lay staring up at the of watching the glow 1
of  an  occasional  leprechaun  lantern  flying  and  of more spectacular he was 1
itching  to  get  back  on  his wronski somehow oliver wood had never managed to 1
convey with

with  grams what that move was supposed to look harry saw in on the and imagined 1
the  sensation  of  hearing  a strong crowd do voice echoed throughout the give 1
arry  never knew whether or not he had actually dropped off like krum might well 1
have  slipped  into actual dreams he weasley was ron on get this is harry sat up 1
quickly  and  the  top  of  his  head hit e he could tell that something was the 1
noises in the campsite singing had he could hear and the sound of people he from 2
the  bunk  and reached for his but who had pulled on his own harry grab a jacket 1
and get outside harry did as he was told and hurried out of the ron by the light 2
of  the  few  fires  that  were still he could fleeing something that was moving 1
across the field toward emitting odd flashes of light and noises like loud roars 1
roars ells were drifting toward then came a burst of strong the

the a crowd of tightly packed and moving together with wands was marching slowly 2
across  the  harry  squinted at they seem then he realized that their heads were 1
hooded and their faces along in four struggling figures were being contorted into 1
into  hough  the  masked  wizards  on  the  ground were and the people rionettes 1
operated  by  invisible  strings  that rose from the into were very more wizards 1
were  joining  the marching laughing and pointing up  tents crumpled and fell as 1
the  marching  crowd once or twice marchers blast a tent out of his way with his 1
several the

the  the floating people were suddenly illuminated as they passed recognized one 1
of  the campsite the other three looked as they might be his wife and one of the 1
marchers  below  down  with  his  her  nightdress  fell down to reveal and cover 1
herself  up as the crowd below her screeched and with  ron watching the smallest 1
muggle  who  had  begun  to spin a sixty feet above the his head flopping limply 1
from  side to is  hermione and ginny came hurrying toward pulling coats  weasley 1
right behind at the same and percy emerged from  fully with their sleeves rolled 2
up  and  their  wands going to help the weasley shouted over all the rolling up 1

looked  back as they reached the the  beneath the roberts family was larger than 1
they could to through it to the hooded wizards in the but they were having

having  though  they  were  scared  to perform any spell that might  the colored 1
lanterns  that  had  lit  the  path  to  the stadium were blundering through the 1
children  were  anxious  shouts were reverberating around them in the cold night 1
harry  felt  thither  by  people  whose  faces  he  could not then he heard said 1
hermione stopping so abruptly that harry walked into  where are oh this is stupid 1
stupid he illuminated her wand and directed its narrow beam across sprawled on the 1
the  ver  a  tree  he  said  getting  to his feet with feet that hard not said a 1
drawling voice from behind and hermione turned draco malfoy was standing alone leaning 1
leaning  against  a  looking  utterly  his  arms  he seemed to have scene at the 1
campsite through a gap in the ron told malfoy to do something that harry knew he 2
would

and  at  the  same  a  blast  like  a  bomb  sounded  and a flash of green light 1
momentarily  lit  the  trees  that  supposed  to  said hermione after want to be 1

searching his even though he

as  a great said leading the way off the path into a small and sitting down on a 1
patch  of dry grass at the foot league three times in a row while he was with he 1
took  his small figure of krum out of his set it on walk like the real the model 1
was slightly footed and  much less impressive on his splayed feet than on his was 1

toward their

could  sense  somebody  standing just beyond the range of his e  and without the 1
silence  was  rent  by a voice unlike any and it not a panicked but what sounded 1
like a

a  and  something and glittering erupted from the patch of been struggling to it 1
flew  up  over the treetops and into the the gasped ron as he sprang to his feet 1
staring up at

comprised  of  what looked like emerald with a  its mouth like a as they it rose 1
higher  and  blazing  in  etched  against  the black sky like a new the wood all 1
around  them  erupted  with harry understand but the only possible cause was the 1
sudden appearance of the to illuminate the entire wood like some grisly neon he scanned 1
scanned  who  had conjured the but he see he called come hermione had seized the 1
collar of his jacket and was

was  the  harry  startled to see her face so white and the dark hermione pulling 1
him as hard as she

the  clearing  before  they  had  taken  a few hurried a  nounced the arrival of 1
twenty appearing from thin  harry whirled and in an he registered one each of these 1
these  wand  and  every  wand was pointing right at and without pausing to he he 1
seized  the  other  two and pulled them down onto the roared twenty voices was a 1
blinding  series  of  flashes  and  hair on his head ripple as though a powerful 1
wind  had  a   tion  of  an  inch he saw jets of fiery red light flying over one 1
bouncing  off  tree  rebounding  into  the  darkness  yelled a voice he my  hair 1
stopped blowing he raised his head a little the wizard in him had lowered his he 2
rolled over and saw weasley

their  wands  again  and  were pointing in the she through the dark too said the 1
witch in the woolen dressing shaking her

through  those  a  good  chance we got be said a few of the wizards warningly as 1
diggory squared  raised his marched across the and disappeared into the  watched 2
him vanish with her hands over her afew seconds they heard diggory we got someone 1
someone  ot  shouted sounding highly who is  they heard snapping the rustling of 1
and  then  crunching reemerged from behind the he was carrying a limp figure in 1
ized  the  tea towel at it was crouch did not move or speak as diggory deposited 1
his  elf  the  other  ministry  wizards  were  all staring at for a few his eyes 1
blazing  in  his  white  face  as he stared down at then come to life he said he 1
moved quickly around diggory and strode off toward the

the  diggory  called  after no one else but crouch did not seem prepared to take 1
his  word  for  they  around and the rustling of leaves as he pushed the diggory 1
said  looking  down at unconscious imean to  off said weasley seriously think it 1
was  the the  dark a it requires a said she had a aid diggory held up a wand and 1
showed it to it in her  so clause three of the code of wand use for a no creature 1
creature ermitted to carry or use a  just then there was another and ludo bagman 2
apparated right looking breathless and he spun on the goggling at

at dark he almost trampling winky as he turned inquiringly to did did you get going 1
going  rouch  had  returned  his face was still ghostly and his hands toothbrush 1
mustache  were  both have you said you at the your elf was saving you a seat too 1
bagman  had  just noticed winky lying  happened to  have been said still talking 1
in  the  same  jerky  barely   ing  his  my  elf  has  been  by you you but why 1
comprehension  dawned suddenly on shiny he looked up at the down at and then at 1
he  conjure the dark she know need a for a she had said found her holding if all 1
right with ithink we should hear what got to say for crouch gave no sign that he 2
had  heard  but diggory seemed to lence for he raised his own pointed it at and 1
inky  stirred her great brown eyes opened and she blinked times  sort of watched 1
by the silent she raised herself shakily into she caught sight of and raised her 2
eyes to stare up into his more slowly she looked up into the harry could see the 1
the flected twice in her glassy she gave a looked wildly around  and burst into terrified 1
terrified  aid diggory you know who i a member of the department  the regulation 1
and  control  of magical winky began to rock backward and forward on the her in 1
arry  was  reminded  forcibly  of  dobby in his moments of you the dark mark was 1
conjured here a short while said you were discovered moments right beneath an if 2
you  is  not  doing  winky  is not knowing were found with a wand in your barked 1
brandishing it in front and as the wand caught the green light that was filling the 1
the arry recognized it he said  everyone in the clearing looked at aid my said dropped 1
dropped ropped repeated diggory in this a you threw it aside  after you conjured 2
the   think who talking said very harry potter likely to conjure the dark course 1
mumbled  carried  drop  it  said jerking his thumb toward the trees beneath the 1
missed  it  right  after we got into the said his eyes hardening as he turned to 1
look at winky cowering his found this and you picked it up and thought have with 2
did is not doing magic with squealed tears streaming down the of

of squashed and bulbous i i is just picking it i is not iis not knowing said she 2
looked  very speaking up in front of all these  istry yet determined all the got 1
a squeaky little and the heard doing the incantation was much she looked around at 1
at  or  their sound anything like did said shaking his definitely sound like an 1
it  was  a human said  soon growled looking a simple way of discovering the last 1
spell a wand did you know winky trembled and shook her head her ears as diggory his 1
his wn wand again and placed it tip to tip with roared harry heard hermione as a 2
gigantic  skull  erupted  from  the  point where the two wands but it was a mere 1
shadow  of  it  looked as though it were made of thick gray the ghost of diggory 1
and  the  smoky  skull  vanished in a wisp of said diggory with a kind of savage 1
looking down upon who was still shaking  is not doing she her eyes rolling in is 2
i  is i is not iis a good i using i knowing  been caught diggory with the guilty 1
wand  in  our said weasley about precious few wizards know how to do where would 1
she  have learned amos is said cold anger in every i routinely teach my servants 1
to  conjure  the  dark there was a deeply unpleasant amos diggory looked not at 1
ave  now come very close to accusing the two people in ly to conjure that barked 1
potter  i  suppose you are miliar with the course knows muttered looking highly 1
trust  you  remember the many proofs i have over a long detest the dark arts and 1
those  who practice crouch his eyes inever suggested you had anything to do with 1
amos  diggory  now  reddening  behind his scrubby brown you accuse my you accuse 1
shouted else would she  have learned to conjure picked it up anywhere said might 2
have  picked  it  up  he  said turning to the but she flinched as though he too 1
ctly did you find winky was twisting the hem of her tea towel so violently

violently is finding finding it she in the said conjured the mark could have disapparated 1
disapparated  ight after done leaving wand a clever thing to not using own which 1
could have betrayed and winky here had the misfortune to  wand moments later and 2
pick it

it  have been only a few feet away from the real said did you see winky began to 1
tremble  worse  than  her  giant  eyes flickered and onto then she gulped and is 1
seeing  no  no   said  crouch am fully aware in the ordinary course of you would 1
want to take winky into your department for i ask to deal with diggory looked as 2
though  he  think  much  of  this  suggestion  at  harry that crouch was such an 1
important member of the ministry

ministry  may rest assured that she will be crouch added winky looking up at her 1
eyes brimming with

with  crouch  stared his face somehow each line upon it more deeply there was no 1
pity  in his  has behaved tonight in a manner i would not have believed told her 1
to remain in the i told her to stay there while i find that she disobeyed this means 1
means hrieked prostrating herself at not not

see  the way winky clutched at her tea as she was hermione burst out glaring at 1
cared of and those wizards in masks were levitating you blame wanting to get out 2
of  their  crouch  took  a  step freeing himself from contact with the veying as 1
though she were something filthy and rotten that was

was  have  no  use  for a who disobeys he said looking over at have no use for a 1
servant  who  forgets  what is due to her winky was crying so hard that her sobs 1
echoed  around  which was ended by who said i think take my lot back  the if got 1
any  that told us all it can harry could it please diggory handed harry his wand 1
and  harry pocketed you weasley said but hermione seem to want to  her eyes were 1
still upon the sobbing weasley more she turned and followed harry and ron out of 2
the  clearing  and  going to happen to said the moment they had left the aid way 1
they were treating said hermione calling her all  the and he knows she do it and 2
still going to sack he care how frightened or how upset she was was like she even 1
even  aid hermione rounded on mean she got disgusting the way  i agree with said 1
weasley  beckoning  her now is not the time to discuss elf i want to get back to 1
the tent as as he lost them in the said why was everyone so uptight about

about explain everything back at the said weasley but when they reached the edge 2
of the their progress was witches and wizards was congregated and when they saw weasley 1
weasley oming toward many of them surged  going on in onjured

conjured  course  not  said  weasley know who it it looks like they now excuse i 1
want  to  get to  he led and hermione through the crowd and back into the  there 1
was no sign of the masked though several ruined head was poking out of the going 2
he  called  through  the and ginny got back but the others got them said bending 1
down  and  entering the and hermione entered after bill was sitting at the small 1
kitchen holding a bedsheet charlie had a large rip in his and percy was sporting 2
a  and ginny looked though you get said bill person who conjured the  said found 1
barry  elf  holding but none  the wiser about who actually conured the  said and 1
percy  said  elf  said  sounding with some assistance from and weasley explained 1
what  had  pened  in  the  when they had finished their percy swelled  crouch is 1
quite  right  to  get  rid  of  an  elf  like  he  away  expressly  told her not 1
embarrassing  him  in front of the whole have if been brought up in front of the 1
department for the

the do anything was just in the wrong place at the wrong hermione snapped at who 2
looked  very  taken  hermione had always got on percy than any of the awizard in 1
position  afford  a  going to run amok with a said percy recovering  run shouted 1
just picked it up off the can someone just explain what that skull thing said ron 1
ron urting it such a big told said before anyone else could read about it in the 2
rise  and fall of the dark it been seen for thirteen said weasley course people 1
t  was  almost  like  seeing  back  get  said  still only a shape in the and his 1
followers  sent the dark mark into the air whenever they said terror it you have 1
no too just  ture coming home and finding the dark mark hovering over your about 2
to  find weasley worst the very  there was silence for a then removing the sheet 1
from his  it help us whoever conjured it scared the death eaters away the

the  moment  they saw they all disapparated before got near enough we caught the 1
robertses  before  they  hit  the  having their  ified right said are death what 1
supporters  called  said  think we saw  left of them tonight ones who managed to 1
keep themselves prove it was said it probably he added

added i bet it said ron suddenly we met draco malfoy in the  good as told us his 2
dad  was  one  of  those nutters in we right in with  what were supporters harry 1
everybody flinched most of the wizarding the weasleys always avoided saying said 2
harry   were  supporters  up levitating i what was he said weasley with a hollow 1
their  idea of half the  muggle killings back when was in power were done for i 1
few drinks tonight and resist reminding us all that a  little reunion for he finished 1
finished  if  they  were  the death why did they disapparate when they said have 1
been  pleased  to see your said they really were death they worked very hard to 1
keep  out  of  azkaban when lost and told all sorts of him  ing them to kill and 1
torture i bet be even more than him come they denied ever been involved with him 2
when   went  back  to  their daily i reckon be with do whoever conjured the dark 1
said  hermione they doing it to support for the death or to scare them  guess is 1
as  good  as  said  tell  you  it was only the death eaters who ever knew how to 1
conjure  be  very did it been a death eater even if not very and if mother hears 1
happened be worried get a few more hours sleep try and get an early portkey out of 1
of  arry got back into his bunk with his head he knew he was nearly three in the 1
but  he  felt  and  three days ago felt like much but it had only been three his 1
scar and for the first time in thirteen lord mark peared in the what did these things 1

quickly  as  passing  roberts  at  the of  roberts had a dazed look about and he 1
waved them off a

bit  disorientated  for  a  and  was  big thing they had to make him  they heard 1
urgent  voices  as  they  approached  the  spot where reached they found a great 1
number of witches and wizards  the all clamoring to get away from the campsite as 1
as  had a hurried discussion with they joined the and to tire back to stoatshead 1
hill  before  the sun had really they  catchpole and up the damp lane toward the 1
burrow  in the they were so and thinking longingly of their as they rounded  the 1
burrow  came  into a cry echoed along the thank thank goodness who had evidently 1
been  waiting for them in the front came ward still wearing her bedroom her face 1
pale  and  a  copy daily prophet clutched in her  been so worried  she flung her 1
arms  around weasley and the daily prophet onto the looking harry saw the scenes 1
of  terror  at the  quidditch world complete with a twinkling photograph of mark 1
over  the  all weasley muttered releasing weasley and staring around at them all 1

enough  to  quash  the  rumors that from the woods an hour remains to be oh said 1

moving  without  and  was  rolling  and  from side to quite independently of the 1
normal  eye  then  ing  into  the back of the so that all they could see was the 1
stranger  reached  he  stretched  out  a  hand  that was as and dumbhedore shook 1
muttering  words  harry  he  seemed to be some inquiry of the who shook his head 1
unsmilingly and replied bledore nodded and gestured the man to the empty seat on 2

chapped  except  dumbledore  and  who  both put their hands but the sound echoed 1
dismally  into  the and they stopped seemed too transfixed by bizarre appearance 1
to do more than harry muttered to the one your dad went to help this

this  said  ron  in  a awed  happened to hermione happened to his  ron whispered 1
watching moody with moody seemed totally indifferent to his ignoring the jug of 1

event  that  has  not  been  held  for  over  a  pleasure to inform you that the 1
triwizard  tournament  will  be  joking  said  fred weasley the tension that had 1
filled the hall ever since arrival nearly one and dumbledore chuckled  am not he 2
now  that  you  mention  i  did hear an lent one over the summer about a a and a 1
leprechaun  who  professor  mcgonagall cleared her throat  maybe this is not the 1
said was ah the  wizard some of you will not know what this tournament those who 2
do  know will forgive me for giving a short and allow ander triwizard tournament 1
was  first established some seven hundred  competition between the three largest 1
european schools of achampion was selected to represent each and the three peted 2
in three magical the schools took it in turns to the and it was generally agreed 2
to  be  a  most excellent way of  witches and wizards of different nationalities 1
that  the so the tournament was hermione looking but her anxiety did not seem to 1
be  shared   by  the  majority  of  students in the many of them were  and harry 1
himself  was  far  more  interested  in  hearing  about in about deaths that had 1
happened hundreds of years have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate 1
reinstate  f  which  has  been  very  our  own  departments  of  tional  magical 1
cooperation  and  magical  games  and sports have decided another we have worked 1
hard  over  the  summer  to  ensure that will find himself or herself in mortal 1
heads  of  beauxbatons and durmstrang will be arriving with in and the selection 1
of  the  three  champions will take at judge will decide which students are most 1
worthy  to  compete  their and a thousand galleons personal prize going for fred 1
weasley  hissed down the his face lit with prospect of such glory and he was not 1
the  only  person  self as the hogwarts at every house harry could see people at 1
or else whispering fervently to their but then dumbledore and the hall quieted once 1
once  hough  i  know  all  of  you  will  be to bring the triwizard heads of the 1
participating  along  with  the  ministry of have  age restriction on contenders 1
this only students who  years or older be allowed to put forward their names for 1
for  umbledore  raised  his voice for several people had made of and the weasley 1
twins  were  suddenly  looking furious a measure given that the tournament tasks 1
will  still  be difficult we and it is highly unlikely that students below sixth 1
and year with i will personally be ensuring that no underage student into making 2
them  his  light  blue eyes twinkled as they over and mutinous therefore beg you 1
not to waste your time self if you are under

under  delegations  from  beauxbatons  and durmstrang will be in with us for the 1
greater  part  of this i know that you  eign guests while they are with and will 1
give  your  to   champion  when  he or she is and it is and i know how all to be 1
alert  and  rested  as you enter your lessons tomorrow dumbledore sat down again 1
and  turned  to talk to there was a and banging as all the students got to their 1
feet  and  the  rance do said george who had not joined the crowd moving but was 1
standing  up and glaring at seventeen in why we have a not stopping me said fred 1
also scowling at the top get to do all sorts of stuff never be allowed to do and 2
a  galleons  prize  said  a faraway look on his a thousand said be the only ones 1
left  here  if  you  and george set off for the entrance fred and george ing the 1
ways in which dumbledore might stop those who were

were this impartial judge going to decide who the champions said  said them have 2
to  i  reckon  a couple of drops of aging  tion might do  knows not of said  but 1
not  the  one  who  decides who the champion is said  to me like once this judge 1
knows who wants to choose the  school and never mind how old they trying to stop 2
us  our have said hermione in a worried voice as they walked through a concealed 1
behind  a  tapestry  and  started  up narrower  said fred that was years the fun 1
without  a  bit  of what if we find out how to get fancy ron asked cool to but i 1
they  might  want  someone  dunno  if learned  definitely came gloomy voice from 1

through the mass of occupied chintz chairs and the down at the same small circular 1

trelawney  was  peering down at harry with the tragic whenever she saw the usual 1
large  amount of and bangles glittered person in the  are my she said mournfully 1
to inner eye sees past your  brave face to the troubled soul and i regret to say 2
that  difficult  times  ahead  for  most  i fear the thing you dread and perhaps 1
sooner  than  you  her  voice  dropped  almost  to a ron rolled his eyes at who 1
professor  trelawney swept past them and seated herself in a facing the lavender 1

they  reveal  only to those who the steps human destiny may be deciphered by the 1
planetary  which   but  thoughts  had the perfumed fire always made him feel and 1
professor  rambling  talks on never held him exactly spellbound he help thinking 1
about  what  she had just said  thing you dread will indeed come to but hermione 1
was  harry  thought  professor  trelawney really was he dreading anything at the 1
moment at unless you counted  had been but what did professor trelawney he had long 1
long onclusion that her brand of fortunetelling was really no more spooky of for 2
that  time  at  the  end  of  last  when  she had made the  voldemort rising and 1

riveted  by this was saying that saturn was surely in a heavens at the moment of 1
your  your dark your mean tragic young in i think i am right in my that you were 1

it  in  a  of having been made to disembowel a barrel full of horned know why in 1
such  a  foul  said  ron  to  harry  as they watched hermione teaching neville a 1
scouring  charm to remove the frog aid it was common knowledge that snape really 1
wanted  the  dark  to  get  it for the fourth year snape had disliked all of and 1
shown it he seemed strangely wary of displaying overt to  whenever harry saw the 2
two of them together or when in corridors had the distinct impression that snape 2
was  avoiding r reckon a bit scared of you harry said if moody turned snape into 1
a  horned  said  his  eyes  misting   bounced him all around his  the gryffindor 1
fourth  years  were  looking  forward  to  first  so  arrived  early on thursday 1
lunchtime  and queued up outside his even the only person missing was who turned 1
up just in n  harry finished her sentence for or we get decent they hurried into 2
three chairs right in front of the took  dark a guide to and unusually soon they 2
heard  distinctive  clunking footsteps coming down the and he entered as strange 1
and  frightening  as they could just see his wooden underneath his can put those 1
he  stumping  over  to  his desk and sitting you need they returned the books to 1
their  ron looking moody took out a shook his long mane of grizzled gray scarred 1
and  began  to  call  out  his  normal eye moving steadily  magical eye swiveled 1
fixing  upon  each  student  as  he  or  he  when  the  last person had declared 1
themselves  had a letter  from professor lupin about this seems had a pretty in 1
ark  creatures  covered  red  and  is that there was a general murmur of  behind 1
behind  dealing with said here to bring you up to scratch on what wizards can do 1
to each got one year with

 with you ron blurted magical eye spun around to stare at ron looked extremely but 1
but  fter a moment moody smiled first time harry had seen do his heavily scarred 1
face  look  more twisted and contorted than to know that he ever did anything as 1
friendly  as ron  be arthur moody father got me out of a very tight corner a few 1
days staying just the one special favor to one and then back to my quiet he gave 2
a  harsh and then clapped his gnarled hands into they come in many strengths and 1
according  to  the  ministry of supposed to teach you countercurses and leave to 1
show  you  what  illegal dark curses look like until in to be old enough to deal 1
with it till but professor got he reckons you can and i the sooner you know what 2
up   how  are  you supposed to defend yourself against something about to put an 1
illegal  curse  on  you going to tell you going to do it nice and polite to your 1
you  need  to be you need to put that miss when lavender jumped and she had been 1
showing parvati her completed the apparently magical eye could see through solid 2
as  well back of his  do any of you know which curses are most heavily punished 1
everal  hands  rose  tentatively into the including and moody though his magical 1
eye was still fixed on said ron dad told me about is it called the imperius or

or  said  moody father would know that gave the ministry a lot of trouble at one 1
the  imperius   moody  got  heavily to his mismatched opened his desk and  three 1
large  black spiders were scuttling around inside harry  him hated moody reached 1
into  the  caught  one of the and held it in the palm that they could all see he 1
then pointed his wand at it the spider leapt from hand on a fine thread of silk and 1
and  orward  as though on a it stretched out its legs then a  thread and landing 1
on the where it began to cartwheel and the spider rose onto two of its hind legs 2
and  went  a   everyone was laughing except  do he like would if i did it to the 1
laughter died away almost said moody quietly as the spider balled itself up and began 1
began could make it jump out of the drown throw itself down

down  ron  gave  an  involuntary  there  were a lot of witches and wizards being 1
controlled  by  the said and harry knew he was talking about the days in had job 1
for the trying to sort out who was being forced to and was acting of their own free 1
free  imperius  curse  can  be  and be teaching you but it takes of  and not got 1
better avoid being hit with it if you

you he and everyone  moody picked up the somersaulting spider and threw it back 1
back lse know another illegal hand flew into the air again and to slight did the 1
the  nly  class  in  which  neville usually volunteered information best neville 1
looked  surprised  at his own said his magical eye rolling right over to fix on 1
one  cruciatus  said  neville  in  a  small  but distinct moody was looking very 1
intently  at  this time with both  he his magical eye swooping down to check 1
register neville nodded but moody made no further turning back to the class 1
class  e  reached into the jar for the next spider and placed it upon apparently 1
too scared to  cruciatus said to be a bit bigger for you to get the pointing his 2
wand  at  the  the spider it was now larger than a abandoning all ron  his chair 1
as far away from desk as moody raised his wand pointed it at the and at the legs 2
bent in upon its it rolled over and began to  rocking from side to no sound came 2
from  but  harry  it  would  have  been moody did not remove his and the spider 1
shudder and jerk more violently hermione said harry looked around at she was not 2
at the but at and following her saw that hands were clenched upon the desk in of 1
of  nuckles  his  eyes  wide and  moody raised his the legs but it continued to 1
moody  and  the  spider  shrank  back  to  its  proper he put he said moody need 1
thumbscrews  or knives to torture someone can perform the cruciatus that one was 1
very popular once anyone know any harry looked from the looks on he guessed they 2
were all what was going to happen to the last hand shook slightly for she raised 2
it into the said looking at hermione several people looked uneasily around at including 1
including aid another slight smile twisting his lopsided the last avada the killing 1
killing  e  put  his hand into the glass and almost as though it spider scuttled 1
frantically  around  the  bottom of the trying trapped and placed it upon the it 1
started to scuttle across

across moody raised his and harry felt a sudden thrill of oody there was a flash 2
of blinding green light and a rushing as a something was soaring through the air 2
the spider rolled over but unmistakably several of the students stifled ron had 1
had ackward and almost toppled off his seat as the spider

spider moody swept the dead spider off the desk onto the he said and no no blocking 1
blocking  nly one known person has ever survived and sitting right in harry felt 1
his  face  redden  as eyes of looked into his he everyone else looking around at 1
him harry stared at the blank fascinated by but not really seeing it at  so that 2
was how his parents had exactly like that had  and unmarked had they simply seen 2
the  flash of green light and of before life was wiped from their harry had been 1
picturing  his  deaths  over  and  over since found out they had been ever since 1
found  out  what had wormtail had betrayed his whereabouts to who had come to at 1
their  how  voldemort had killed father how james had  hold him while he shouted 1
at  his  wife to take harry on lily told her to move aside so that he could kill 1
how to her refused to stop shielding her and so voldemort had turning his wand on 1
on  arry  knew  these  details because he had heard his voices he dementors last 1
year that was the terrible power of the de to relive the worst memories of their 2
and  in their own moody was speaking from a great it seemed to with a massive he 1
pulled  himself back to the present and listened to acurse that needs a powerful 1
bit  of magic behind it wands out now and point them at me and say the and i but 1
that  not here to teach you how to do if no why am i showing because got to  got 1
to appreciate what the worst you want to find yourself in facing constant he and 2
the  whole  class  jumped   those  three  curses  and  cruciatus  known  as the 1
unforgivable the use of any one of them on a fellow is  life sentence in what up 2
what  got  to  teach  you to you need you need but most of you need to practice 1
ceasing get out your copy this they spent the rest of the lesson taking notes on 2
each  of  spoke  until the bell rang when moody had dismissed them  a torrent of 1
talk  burst  most  people were discussing the in  see it when he killed it like 1
hey  were  talking about the harry as though it had been some spectacular but he 1
found  it  very  entertaining  it  had  she  said tensely to harry and the ruddy 1
library  said  said  hermione pointing up a side neville was standing halfway up 1
the  staring at the stone wall opposite him with look he had worn when moody had 1
demonstrated the cruciatus hermione said neville looked he his voice much higher 2
than  i wonder for are you all said neville gabbled in the same unnaturally 1
interesting dinner mean lesson for ron gave harry a startled

startled  but  an  odd clunking noise sounded behind and they turned to  limping 1
toward all four of them fell watching him but it was in a much lower and gentler 2
growl than they had yet all he said to you come up to my come we can have a cup of 1
of  eville  looked  even more frightened at the prospect of tea he  moody turned 1
his  magical  eye  upon  all  are  said almost blue eye quivered slightly in its 1
socket  as  it  surveyed got to it seems but got to no point come got some books 1
that  might  interest   neville looked pleadingly at and but they say so neville 1
had  no  choice  but  to  allow  himself to be steered is was that said watching 1
neville  and  moody  turn the said looking said ron to harry as they set off for 1
the  great  and  george were he really knows his when he did  avada the way that 1
spider  just  just  snuffed it right but ron fell suddenly silent at the look on 1
face  and  reached  the  great  when  he  said  he  supposed  they had better a 1
redictions  since  they  would  take  hermione  did  not  join in with harry and 1
conversation during  and then left for the library harry and ron walked back who 2
had been thinking of nothing else all through now the  unforgivable curses moody 2
and dumbledore be in trouble with the ministry if harry asked as they approached 2
the  fat  said  always done things his and been getting in trouble for i attacks 1
first and asks later is  the fat lady swung forward to reveal the entrance and they 1
they  ommon  which was crowded and we get our divination said on they went up to 1
the  dormitory  to fetch their books and to sitting on his he looked a good deal 1
calmer than at the though still not entirely his eyes were rather all harry asked 1
asked  aid  just  reading  this book professor moody lent he held up the magical 1
water plants of the professor sprout told professor moody really good at neville 1
neville  here  was  a  faint  note  of pride in his voice that had thought like 1
elling  neville  what  professor sprout had harry had been  cheering neville for 1
neville very rarely heard that he was at

at thing professor lupin would have harry and ron took their copies of unfogging 2

look  if she knew they doing their  staring around the trying to think of a kind 1
of  misfortune fred and george sitting together against the opposite heads over 1
a  single piece of it was most unusual to see fred and  and working they usually 1
liked  to be in the thick of of there was something secretive about the way they 1
were  on  and  harry  was  reminded  of how they had sat together writing he had 1
thought  then  that it was another order form for  look like that this if it had 1
they would surely have he wondered whether it had anything to do with entering the 1
the  s  harry  george  shook his head at scratched out something in a very quiet 1

olded  her  and  held out her leg  harry pulled off reply and offered hedwig his 1

shivering  slightly waiting for the durmstrang party to were gazing hopefully up 1
at  the  for  a  few the silence was broken only by madame huge and but then you 1
hear  said ron harry a loud and oddly eerie noise was drifting toward them from 1
muffled  rumbling  and  sucking  as  though an immense vacuum along a yelled lee 1
pointing down at at the from their position at the top of the lawns overlooking 1
overlooking  he  smooth  black surface of the water that the surface was at some 1
disturbance  was  taking  place  deep  in  the great bubbles were waves were now 1
washing over the muddy banks out in the very of whirlpool as if a giant plug had 2
just been pulled out of the what seemed to be a black pole began to rise slowly out 1
out nd then harry saw the ahe said to ron and  the ship rose out of the gleaming 2
in  the  it  had  a  strangely  skeletal look about as though it were a and the 1
himmering  at  its  portholes looked like ghostly with a the  emerged bobbing on 1
the turbulent and began to glide the  moments they heard the splash of an anchor 2
being  thrown down thud of a plank being lowered onto the people were they could 1
see  their  silhouettes passing the in all of harry seemed to be built along the 1
lines  of  crabbe as they drew walking up the lawns into the light streaming saw 1
that their bulk was really due to the fact that they  matted but the man who was 2
leading  them  up  to  the  castle  sleek and like his  he called heartily as he 1
walked  up  the are my dear how are  thank professor dumbledore karkaroff had a 1
tuous  when  he  stepped into the light pouring from the front  that he was tall 1
and  thin  like  but his white hair was and in a small did not entirely hide his 1
rather weak he shook hands with both of his

his  old he looking up at the castle and his teeth were rather and harry noticed 1
that  his  smile  did  not extend to his good it is to be how come into the you 1
iktor has a slight head karkaroff beckoned forward one of his as the boy harry a 1
a a prominent curved nose and thick black he need the punch  gave or the hiss in 2
his to recognize that

hogwarts  students  filed  back   steps  behind  the  party  from viktor  only a 1
quidditch said aquidditch ron looking at her as though he believe his one of the 2
best  seekers  in  the  i had no idea he was as they recrossed the entrance hall 1
with  the rest of the great harry saw lee jordan jumping up and down on the look 1
at  the  back  of  several  girls  were  frantically searching  as they walked i 1

hall  and settled down filing up to the top table and taking their last in line 1
rofessor and madame when their headmistress the pupils from beauxbatons leapt to 2
their  a  few  of the hogwarts students  appeared quite and did not resume their 1
seats  until  madame had sat down on dumbledore remained and a silence fell over 1

hermione  sat  do  said  hermione  soon  the halloween feast seemed to take much 1
longer  than  it  second  feast  in two harry seem to fancy the extravagantly he 1
would  have  like  everyone  else  in  the  judging by the craning the impatient 1
expressions  on every the and the standing up  bledore had finished eating harry 1
simply  wanted  the  to  been  selected as at long the golden plates returned to 1

carved  pumpkins  were  plunging  them into a state the goblet of fire now shone 1
more  brightly than anything of the flames almost painful on the everyone a few 1
eople  kept checking their  lee jordan two seats away from the flames inside the 1
goblet  turned  suddenly  red  sparks  began   a tongue of flame shot into the a 1
charred  piece  of  whole room dumbledore caught the piece of parchment and held 1
it  at so that by the light of the which had turned back to champion for he in a 1
clear be viktor surprises yelled ron as a storm of applause and cheering the saw 2
viktor  krum  rise from the slytherin table and slouch up walked along the staff 1
and disappeared through the door into  boomed so loudly that everyone could hear 2
even over all the

champion  for said fleur harry shouted as the girl who so resembled a veela got 1
hook back her sheet of silvery blonde and swept up between the

a bit of an harry two of the girls who had not been selected had dissolved into 1
into  eads on their  when fleur delacour too had vanished into the side fell was 1
a  silence  so stiff with excitement you could almost the and the goblet of fire 1
turned  red  once sparks showered shot high into the and from its tip dumbledore 1
pulled  the   hogwarts he cedric said ron but nobody heard him except the uproar 1
from  the  was  too every single hufflepuff had jumped to his or her cedric made 1
his way past grinning and headed off toward the  the applause for cedric went on 2
so  long that it was some  dumbledore could make himself heard dumbledore called 1
happily  as  at last the tumult died we now our three i am sure i can count upon 1
all  of including beauxbatons and to give your champions every ounce of support 1
y  cheering  your  champion  you  will  contribute in a very real but dumbledore 1
suddenly  stopped  and it was apparent to what racted the fire in the goblet had 1
just  turned  red  sparks were a suddenly into the and borne upon it was another 1
piece  of  it  dumbledore reached out a long hand and seized the  he held it out 1
and  stared at the name written upon was ing which dumbledore stared at the slip 1
in  his  and  everyone  in  and then dumbledore cleared his throat and read out 1
chapter  seventeen  the  four  champions  harry sat aware that every head in the 1
great  hall had turned  he felt he was surely he had not heard there was no a as 1
though  of  angry was starting to fill students were standing up to get a better 1
look  at harry as up at the top professor mcgonagall had got to her feet and and 1
professor karkaroff to whisper urgently to professor who rowning harry turned to 2
ron  and beyond he saw the long table ing put my name harry said know i  both of 1
them stared just as blankly

blankly  at  the top professor dumbledore had straightened nodding to  he called 1
up if you hermione giving harry a slight harry got to his trod on the hem of his 2
and stumbled between the gryffindor and hufflepuff it felt like an long  seem to 2
be  getting  any  nearer  at and he could feel as though each were a the buzzing 1
grew louder and after what like an he was right in front of feeling the stares of 1
of hrough the said he harry moved off along the hagrid was seated right at the he 1
he  t  or  or  give any of his usual signs of he looked completely and stared at 1
harry  as  he passed like everyone harry the hall and found himself in a smaller 1
lined  with  paintings  of  some fire was roaring in the fireplace opposite  the 1
faces  in  the portraits turned to look at him as he of the frame of her picture 1
and  into  the one next to a the wizened witch started whispering in his  viktor 1
cedric  and fleur delacour were grouped around the strangely silhouetted against 1

staring into the fleur delacour looked around threw back her sheet of silvery is 2
she zey want us back in ze she thought he had come to deliver a harry know how to 1
to  e  just  stood  looking  at the three it struck him how very hem there was a 1
sound of scurrying feet behind and ludo the harry by the arm and led him  he squeezing 1
squeezing  e  approaching  the  fireside  and  addressing the other i incredible 1
though  it  may  seem  fourth  triwizard viktor krum straightened his surly face 1
darkened  as he he looked from bagman to harry and back again as though sure he 1
heard  what  bagman  had  fleur tossed her and vairy funny meester bagman not at 1
name  just came out of the goblet of  thick eyebrows contracted cedric was still 1
looking politely fleur

fleur evidently zair been a she said contemptuously to cannot is too  it is said 2
rubbing  his  smooth  chin  and smiling down as you the age restriction was only 1
imposed  this year as an  as his come out of the i i think there can be any out 1
own  in  the  harry will just have to do the best he the door behind them opened 1
and a large group of people came followed closely by professor madame professor 1
professor  nd  professor  harry heard the buzzing of the hundreds of side of the 1
before  professor  mcgonagall closed the  said fleur at striding over to her are 1
saying zat

zat  zis  little  boy  is  to  compete  somewhere under numb disbelief he felt a 1
ripple  of  little madame maxime had drawn herself up to her and the top of her 1
andsome  head  brushed  the  and  her  gigantic bosom  is ze meaning of she said 1
rather like to know that said professor he was wearing a steely and his blue eyes 1
eyes were like chips of hogwarts i remember anyone telling school is allowed two 2
champions have i not read the rules he gave a short and nasty  said madame whose 2
enormous  hand  with its many superb was resting upon cannot two it is most were 1
under  the  impression  that  your age line would keep out said his steely smile 1
still  in though his eyes were colder we of have brought along a wider selection 1
of  candidates  wn  no  fault but said snape his black eyes were alight with  go 1
blaming  dumbledore  for determination to break he has been  crossing lines ever 1
since  he  arrived  here   said dumbledore and snape went though his eyes still 1
glinted  malevolently  through  his curtain of greasy black professor dumbledore 1
was  now  looking down at who looked right to discern the expression of the eyes 1
behind the you put your name into the goblet of he asked  said he was very aware 2
of everybody watching him snape a noise of impatient disbelief in the you ask an 2
older student to put it into the goblet of fire gnoring said harry but of course 2
is  cried madame snape was now shaking his his ip could not have crossed the age 1
said  professor  mcgonagall  am sure are all agreed on that  must made a mistake 1
wiz  ze  said  madame  is of said dumbledore you know perfectly well you did not 1
make  a  said professor  gall what harry could not have crossed the line and as 1
essor dumbledore believes that he did not persuade an older  that should be good 2
enough  for  everybody  else   she  shot a very angry look at professor said his 1
voice  unctuous  once  are our er surely you will agree that this is most bagman 1
wiped  his  boyish  face  with  his handkerchief and at was standing outside the 1
circle  of  the  his face half in  the half darkness making him look much giving 1
him  an   when  he it was in his usual curt  must follow the and the rules state 1
clearly  that  those   of  the goblet of fire are bound to compete in the  barty 1
knows  the  rule  book back to said beaming and turning  karkaroff and madame as 1
though  the matter was now  insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of 1

the goblet of fire once and we will continue adding nly it work like said goblet 2
of  just  gone  out   reignite  until  the  start  of  the next tournament which 1
durmstrang will most certainly not be exploded all our meetings and negotiations 2
and  i little expected something ihave half a mind to leave growled a voice from 1
near the leave your pion got to all got to binding magical like ledore moody had 2
just entered the he limped toward the and with step there was a loud said afraid 2
i  understand   harry  could  tell  he was trying to sound as though what moody 1
arely  worth  his but his hands gave him they had balled said moody very someone 1
put  name  in   that goblet knowing have to compete if it came someone wished to 1
give two bites at ze said madame

madame  quite  madame said bowing to shall be lodging  plaints with the ministry 1
of  magic and the international got reason to growled funny i hear him saying a 1
hould  burst  out  fleur  stamping her ze chance to we all been to be chosen for 1
weeks and ze honor for our  a thousand galleons in prize money is a chance many would 1
would hoping potter is going to die for said with the merest trace

trace  an  extremely  tense  silence  followed  these ludo who was looking xious 1
bounced  nervously  up  and  down on his feet and a  thing to all know professor 1
moody  considers the morning wasted if he to murder him before said karkaroff he 1
is  now teaching his dents to fear assassination an odd quality in a defense but 1
no  doubt  you  had  your am growled it was a skilled witch or  zard who put the 1
name  in  that  what  evidence  is  zere  of  said  madame  throwing up her they 1
hoodwinked  a  very  powerful  magical  said  would have needed an exceptionally 1
strong  confundus  charm  to  bamboozle  that  only three schools compete in the 1
guessing  they  submitted  name afourth to make sure he was the only one in his 1
eem to have given this a great deal of said karkaroff a very ingenious theory it 2
is of i heard you recently got of your birthday presents contained a cunningly disguised 1
disguised efore realizing it was a carriage so understand if we you

you  are  those turn innocent occasions to their moody retorted nacing my job to 1
think the way dark wizards karkaroff you to

to  said  dumbledore  harry  wondered for a moment whom he was but then realized 1
could  hardly  be  real  first  moody fell though still surveying karkaroff with 1
satisfaction face was this situation we do not said speaking to everyone gathered 1
gathered  n  the  seems  to that we have no choice but to accept both harry have 1
been chosen to compete in the they will ut dear madame if you have an i would be 2
delighted  to  hear  dumbledore but madame maxime did not she merely she the  ly 1
one  snape  looked  karkaroff  looked rather shall we crack he rubbing his hands 1
together  and  smiling  the  to  give  our champions their want to do the crouch 1
seemed to come out of a deep he the first  he moved forward into the close harry 2
thought  he  looked shadows beneath his eyes and a papery look about his skin at 1
the  quidditch  world first task is designed to test your he told and we are not 1
going to be telling you what it courage in the quality in a very first task will 2
take  place  on  november  the  in  front  of and the panel of champions are not 1
permitted  to ask for or accept help of  complete the tasks in the the champions 1
will face the first with their they will receive information about the second is 1
is  ing  to  the  demanding and nature of the the champions rom crouch turned to 1
look  at   think  is think said who was looking at crouch with mild you sure you 1
like  to  stay at hogwarts  i must get back to the said is a very very difficult 1
time  at  the  left young weatherby in very a little if truth be come and have a 1
drink  before  you  at  said said bagman all happening at hogwarts you much more 1
exciting  here  than  at the think said crouch with a touch of his old karkaroff 1
maxime  said  but madame maxime had already put her arm around shoulders swiftly 1
out  of  the  harry  could  hear them both talking very into the great karkaroff 1
beckoned to and though in isuggest you go up to said smiling at both of am  sure 2
gryffindor  and  hufflepuff  are  waiting  to  celebrate with prive them of this 1
excellent  excuse  to  make  a great deal harry glanced at who and they left the 1
great hall was deserted the candles had burned giving the pumpkins an flickering 1
flickering aid with a slight playing against each other

other said he really think of anything to the inside of his head seemed to be in 2
complete  as  though  his  brain  had  been tell said cedric as they reached the 1
entrance which was now torches in the absence of the goblet of did you get your 1
your  aid  staring  up  at put it i was telling the said harry could tell cedric 1
believe  see  instead  of going up the marble cedric headed for a door tening to 1
him going down the stone steps beyond he started

started  was  anyone except ron and hermione going to believe or they himself in 1
for  the  yet  how  could anyone think when he was facing had three more magical 1
education than he had he was now that not only sounded very but which were to be 2
performed  in  thought  about  fantasized  about but it had been a an idle never 1
seriously  considered   but  someone else had considered someone else had wanted 1
him  in   made sure he was to give him a he think to see him make a fool of they 1
were  likely to get their but to get him was moody just being his usual paranoid 1
someone  have  put  in  goblet as a a practical did anyone really want him harry 1
was able to answer that at someone wanted him someone had him dead ever since he 2
had been a year lord but how  ensured that name got into the goblet of voldemort 2
was  to   some distant in feeble and yet in that dream he had just before he had 1
awoken  with  not been he had been talking to plotting harry got a shock to find 1
himself facing the fat lady he  feet were carrying it was also a surprise to see 1
see  ened  witch  who  had flitted into her painting when he  downstairs was now 1
sitting  smugly  beside  the fat she  ture lining seven staircases to reach here 1
before both she down at him with the keenest said the fat just told me just been 2
chosen  as school said harry most certainly said the pale witch the said the fat 1
lady  and she swung forward on her hinges to let harry into the common the blast 1
of  noise  that  met  ears  when the portrait opened almost next thing he he was 1
being  wrenched  inside the common room by  pairs of and was facing the whole of 1
gryffindor all of nd told us bellowed he looked half half deeply

deeply  did  you do it without getting a roared  harry know but angelina had now 1
swooped down upon if it be at a

a be able to pay back diggory for that last quidditch

quidditch  another  of the gryffindor got come and have some not i had enough at 1
the  feast  but nobody wanted to hear that he nobody wanted to hear that name in 1
the  not  one single person seemed to have noticed to lee jordan had unearthed a 1
gryffindor  banner from and he draping it around harry like a harry get whenever 1
he  tried  to  the  staircase  up  to the the crowd around him closed forcing on 1
stuffing  crisps  and peanuts into his everyone wanted to how how he had tricked 1
age  line  and managed to get his  he over and over know how it  but for all the 1
notice anyone he might just as well at  he bellowed after nearly half an george going 1
going  to  he wanted more than anything to find ron and to find a of them seemed 1
to  be  in  the  common insisting that he needed  the little creevey brothers as 1
they  attempted  to  waylay him  naged to shake everyone off and climb up to the 1
dormitory  as  to  his  great  he found ron was lying on his bed in the fully he 1
looked  up when harry slammed the door behind  you harry aid he was but it was a 1
very  strained  sort  of  harry  became   that  he was still wearing the scarlet 1
gryffindor  banner  that  to take it but it was knotted very ron lay on the bed 1
truggle to remove he when harry had finally removed the banner and thrown it

at the dark red velvet now hiding one of the would believe  chapter eighteen the 2
weighing  of  the wands when harry woke up on sunday it took him a moment to he 1
iserable  and  then  the  memory  of  the previous night rolled  ripped back the 1
curtains  of  his  own  intending  to talk to to him to find that bed was he had 1
obviously gone down to harry dressed and went down the spiral staircase into the 2

hermione  accepted his story without  of course i knew you entered she said when 1

all  ry sat down against a wall and wrote his ear you told me to keep you posted 1
on happening at so here if but the triwizard happening this year and on saturday 1
saturday  icked  as  a fourth i who put my name in the goblet of  other hogwarts 1
champion  is  cedric  from  hufflepuff  he  paused at this he had an urge to say 1
something  about the anxiety that seemed to have settled inside his chest since 1
ranslate this into so he simply dipped his quill back hope and buckbeak  he told 2
getting  to  his  feet and brushing straw off his at  hedwig fluttered down onto 1
his  shoulder and held out her  use harry told looking around for the school got 1
to use

use hedwig gave a very loud hoot and took off so suddenly that

that  she  kept  her back to harry all the time he was tying his to the barn owl 1
had flown harry reached out to stroke but ly and soared up into the rafters out of 1
of  hen  harry  said  my  if  harry  had thought that matters would improve once 1
everyone  got   ing  the following day showed him how mistaken he he rest of the 1
school  once  he  was  back  at  lessons  it was that like the thought harry had 1
entered  himself  for  the  unlike  they  did  not  seem the who were usually on 1
excellent  terms  with  the  had   markably  cold  toward  the  whole lot of one 1
herbology  to  it  was  plain that the hufflepuffs felt that harry had a  by the 1
fact  that  hufflepuff  house very rarely got any and was one of the few who had 1
ever  given  them  having  beaten   ernie  macmillan  and justin with whom harry 1
normally  got  on   talk  to him even though they were repotting bouncing bulbs 1
augh  rather unpleasantly when one of the bouncing bulbs and smacked him hard in 1
the  ron  talking  to harry hermione making very forced but though both answered 1
her  they avoided eye contact with each harry thought even professor sprout him 1
he was head of hufflepuff he would have been looking forward to seeing hagrid under 1
under f magical creatures meant seeing the slytherins too first with them since becoming 1
becoming alfoy arrived at cabin with his familiar sneer firmly in the he said to 2
crabbe  and goyle the moment he got within  earshot of your autograph better get 1
a signature because i going to be around much half the triwizard champions have how 1
how  eckon going to ten minutes into the first my  crabbe and goyle guffawed but 1
malfoy had to stop hagrid  emerged from the back of his cabin balancing a tower 1
tower  arge  to  the hagrid proceeded to explain that the reason the skrewts had 1
been killing one another was an excess of and would be for each student to fix a 2
leash on a skrewt thing about this plan was that it distracted malfoy this thing 2
for a he repeated in staring into one of the  exactly are we supposed to fix the 2
around  the  the  blasting  the said might want ter put on yer  hide as an extra 1
harry come here help me with this

this  real was totalk to harry away from the rest of the he  until everyone else 1
had set off with their then turned to in the school  of the harry corrected eyes 2
looked  very  anxious  under  his wild idea who put yeh in fer believe i do said 1
concealing with difficulty the rush of he felt at  i hagrid say it i believe yeh 2
dumbledore ieves

lieves  i  knew  who did do said harry  the pair of them looked out over the the 1
class  was and the skrewts were now over three feet and extremely no longer less 1
and they had developed a kind of shiny they looked cross between giant scorpions 2
and elongated crabs still heads  they had become immensely strong and very hard to 1
to  like  hagrid  said  harry  assumed  he  was  talking  about  the because his 1
classmates  certainly  every  now  and  with one of the ends would causing it to 1
shoot forward and  than one person was being dragged along on their trying to

to  i  hagrid  sighed  looking back down at him with a worried expression on his 1
seems  ter  happen  ter  harry  everything  did seem to happen to that was more 1
ermione  had  said  as they had walked around the and was that ron was no longer 1
talking  to  the  next few days were some of worst at the closest he had feeling 1
like  this  had  been  during  those  in  his second when a had suspected him of 1
attacking  his  fellow  but ron had thought he could have coped with the rest of 1
the  behavior  back  as  a  but  he going to try and persuade ron to talk it was 1
lonely  with dislike pouring in on him from all  he could understand the even if 1
he  like  they  had  champion  to he expected nothing less than vicious insults 1
ighly  unpopular  there  and  always  had  because  he  had  helped beat both at 1
quidditch  and  in  the  but  he had hoped the ravenclaws might have found it in 1
their  hearts to support him as much most ravenclaws seemed to think that he had 1
been desperate to tricking the goblet into accepting his then there was the fact 2
that  cedric looked the part of a  exceptionally with his straight dark and gray 1
it was hard was receiving more admiration these cedric or viktor harry girls who 2
had  been  so  keen  to  get autograph begging cedric  school bags one meanwhile 1
there  was  no  reply  from hedwig was refusing to come  professor trelawney was 1
predicting  his  death with even he badly at summoning charms in professor class 1
that  he  was  given  the only person to get apart from really not that hermione 1
tried to reassure him as they left class had been making objects zoom across the 2
room  to  her  some  sort  of  weird  magnet  for  board  wastepaper  and  just 1
oncentrating  properly  why  that said harry darkly as cedric diggory walked by 1
arge  group  of simpering all of whom looked at harry as  double potions to look 1
forward to this double potions was always a horrible but these days it was short 1
short  being  shut in a dungeon for an hour and a half with seemed determined to 1
punish  harry as much as possible for daring was about the most unpleasant thing 1
harry could he had one

one  with  hermione  sitting next to him intoning ignore ignore under her and he 1
see  why  today should be any when he and hermione arrived at dungeon after they 1
found  the ing each and every one of them wearing a large badge on  for one wild 1
moment  harry  thought they were badges he the same in luminous red letters that 1
burnt brightly in the

the  support cedric  the real hogwarts said malfoy loudly as harry this all 1
do he pressed his badge into his and the message upon it to be another which glowed 1
glowed  otter  the slytherins howled with each of them pressed their badges the 1
otter stinks was shining brightly all around he felt the in

in very hermione said sarcastically to pansy parkinson and her who were laughing 2
harder  than  ron was standing against the wall with dean and he but he sticking 1
up for harry said holding out a badge to got but touch my just washed you want a 2
mudblood sliming it some of the anger harry had been feeling for days and his he 2
had  reached  for  his  wand  before  thought  what he them scrambled out of the 1
backing down the  hermione said malfoy said drawing out his own not here to look 2
after  you  now if got the guts for a split they looked into each at exactly the 1
same both

both harry creamed jets of light shot from both hit each other in and off at hit 2
goyle  in  the  and  hit goyle bellowed and put his hands where great ugly boils 1
were springing up whimpering in was er

her  ron had hurried forward to see what was wrong with harry hand away from her 1
it a pretty front teeth  larger than average now growing at an alarming she was 1
was beaver as her teeth past her bottom toward her chin them and let out a terrified 1
terrified what is all this noise said a deadly snape had the slytherins clamored 2
to give their snape a  yellow finger at malfoy and

and  attacked  sir   attacked each other at the same harry he hit snape examined 1
whose face now resembled something that would in a book on poisonous snape said 1
said  got  ron  he  forced hermione to show snape her teeth was doing her though 1
this was difficult as they had now grown down and the other slytherin girls were 2
doubled  up  with silent at ind  snape looked coldly at then see no hermione let 1
out a her eyes filled with she turned on her the way up the corridor and out of 1
of t was that both harry and ron started shouting at snape at lucky their voices 2
echoed  so  much  in the stone for in the for him to hear exactly what they were 1
calling  he  got  the he in his silkiest points from gryffindor and a detention 1
otter  and  now get or be a worth of ears were the injustice of it made him want 1
to curse a slimy he passed walked with ron to the back of the and  bag down onto 2
the  ron  was  shaking  with anger too a it thing was back to normal between but 1
then ron turned and mus leaving harry alone at his on the other side of the back 2
on snape and pressed his potter stinks flashed once more

more  harry sat there staring at snape as the lesson things  if only he knew how 1
to  do the cruciatus have snape flat jerking and said looking around at them his 1
cold black eyes glittering should all have prepared your recipes i want you to brew 1
brew  e  will  be selecting someone on whom to test eyes met and harry knew what 1
was snape was going to poison harry imagined picking up his and sprinting to the 2
front down on greasy head then a knock on the dungeon door burst

burst  it  was  colin  he edged into the beaming at and walked up to desk at the 1
front of the said snape supposed to take harry potter snape stared down his hooked 1
hooked hose smile faded from his eager has another hour of potions to said snape 2
will come when this class is colin went  bagman wants he said the champions have 2
got  to  i   think they want to take harry would have given anything he owned to 1

determinedly ery snape leave your things i want you back down here later to test 2

my  harry  swung  his  bag over his got and headed for the  the slytherin potter 1

closed  the  dungeon door behind you being really said harry heavily as they set 1
off  toward  the  steps into do they want photos daily i said harry what i more 1

of  talking to a had never seen who was wearing magenta viktor krum was standing 1
moodily  in a corner as usual and fheur were in fheur looked a good deal happier 1

where  it  stood  balanced on its quivering my name is rita daily prophet  harry 1

across the attractive blonde rita savage quill has punctured many inflated eputations 1
eputations  aid  rita  yet  and  she  ripped  the top piece of parchment  it and 1
stuffed it into her now she leaned toward harry and made you decide to enter the 2

words the quill had tears fill those startlingly green eyes as our conversation

the  door  of the broom was looked blinking in the bright albus dumbledore stood 1
looking  at  of  squashed  into  the cried rita with every appearance of delight 1
harry  noticed  that  her quill and the parchment had suddenly vanished from of 1
clawed  fingers were hastily snapping shut the clasp of her  she standing up and 1
holding  out  one  of her mannish hands to hope you saw my piece over the summer 1
about the of

skeeter  look  remotely was just making the point that some of your ideas are a 1
nd  that  many  wizards  in  the street  will be delighted to hear the reasoning 1
behind the said with courteous bow and a afraid we will have to discuss the the 1
the  of the wands is about to and it cannot take place if broom very glad to get 1
away from rita harry hurried back into the pions were now sitting in chairs near 2
the and he sat down next up at the where four of the five judges were now sitting 1
sitting adame and ludo rita skeeter settled herself down in a harry saw her slip 2
the  parchment  out  of her bag spread it  of the and place it once more on the 1
introduce said taking his place at the table and talking to the will be checking 2
your  wands  to  ensure  are  tion  before  the  harry hooked and with a jolt of 1
surprise  saw an old ing quietly by the harry had met ollivander before was the 1
hom  harry  had  bought  his own wand over three years ago in  could we have you 1
said  stepping  into   the empty space in the middle of the fleur delacour swept 1
over  to  olhivander  and  handed  him  he  he twirled the wand between his long 1
fingers  like a baton it gold then he held it chose to his eyes and examined it 1
e said and a half and dear

dear  from  ze of a said of my so fleur was part thought making a mental note to 1
tell then bered that ron speaking to

to  said  never  used veela hair of i find it makes  for rather temperamental to 1
each his and if this suits ollivander ran his fingers along the apparently checking 1
checking  then  he  and  a  bunch  of  flowers burst from the wand  very in fine 1
working  said  scooping  up the flowers  and handing them to fleur with her you 1
fleur glided back to her smiling at cedric as he passed this is one of said with 2
much  more  as  cedric  handed  over  his i remember it containing a single the 1
articularly  fine  male must have been seventeen nearly gored me after i plucked 1
his  twelve  and  a  quarter  pleasantly in fine you treat it it last said harry 1
hooked  down  at his own he could see finger marks all ful of robe from his knee 1
and  tried to rub it clean the end of fleur delacour gave him a very patronizing 1
and he  ollivander sent a stream of silver smoke rings across the the pronounced 2
himself  and  then  if  you  viktor krum got up and and toward he thrust out his 1
wand  and  stood  with his hands in the of said is a gregorovitch unless much a 1
ine  though  the styling is never quite what  he lifted the wand and examined it 1
turning  it  over  hornbeam  and dragon he shot at who thicker than  one usually 1
quite ten and a quarter the hornbeam wand let off a blast hike a and a number of 2
birds  of  the end and through the open window into the watery said handing krum 1
back  his  harry got to his feet and walked past krum to he handed over said his 1
pale eyes suddenly how well iharry could remember he could remember it as though 2
it  four  summers  on  his  eleventh  he  had  entered shop with hagrid to buy a 1
ollivander had taken his measurements and then him  to harry had waved what felt 2
like  every  wand  in  the  until at he that suited him which was made of eleven 1
inches  and  contained  feather  from the tail of a ollivander had been very so 1
ompatible with this he had and not until harry asked what curious had olhivander 2
explained  that the phoenix feather in  the same bird that had supplied the core 1
of  lord harry had never shared this piece of information with he was and as far 1
as he was concerned its relation to wand rather as he help being related to aunt 2
he  really  hoped vander about to tell the room about he had a funny rita  quill 1
might  just explode with excitement if he ollivander spent much longer examining 1
wand  than  anyone  he made a fountain of wine shoot out of and handed it to  it 1
was  still  in  perfect you said standing up at the may go back to your  lessons 1
now perhaps it would be quicker just to go down

down  feeling  that  at  last  something  had gone right harry got  black camera 1
jumped up and cleared his  cried bagman the judges and what do you do those said 2
rita  whose  eyes  were  upon harry then perhaps some individual the photographs 1
took  a long madame maxime cast everyone else she and the photographer stand far 1
enough  back  to  get  her  eventually  she had to sit while everyone else stood 1
around kept  around his finger to give it an extra whom harry would been used to 2
this  sort of at the back of the the seemed keenest to get fleur at the but rita 1
skeeter kept and harry into greater then she insisted on separate shots of  they 2
were  free  to  harry went down to hermione there supposed she was still in wing 1
having  her  teeth he ate alone at the end of the thinking of all the extra work 1
on  summoning  charms  that  he  to he came across had an said ron brusquely the 1
moment  he  walked he was  the school barn owl was waiting for him aid got to do 1
our  detentions  tomorrow said he then walked straight out of the not looking at 1
for  a   going  after him sure whether he wanted to talk to him or appealing the 1
lure of answer was too harry strode over to the letter off its and unrolled arry 1
arry  say  everything  i  would  like  to  in  a  too  risky  in case the owl is 1
intercepted  need to talk can you that by the fire in gryffindor tower at one in 1
the  morning  on  the  iknow  better  than  anyone  that you can look after and 1
umbledore  and  moody  i  think  anyone will be able to hurt to be having a good 1
entering  you  in  that  tournament would  right under be on the i still want to 1
hear about anything let me  ofnovember as quickly as you irius chapter nineteen 1
nineteen the hungarian horntail the prospect of talking with sirius was all that 2
sustained   the  only  bright  spot  on  a horizon that had never looked himself 1
school champion had worn off slightly and the fear of  started to sink the first 2
task was drawing steadily he ahead of him hike some horrific barring his he had never 1
never  hey  were  way  beyond anything he had experienced before a not  last one 1
against which had decided who would win the harry

harry finding it hard to think about the future at he felt and would finish the first 1
first  he  see  how  sirius  was going to make him feel any better to perform an 1
unknown  piece of difficult and dangerous magic in  the mere sight of a friendly 1
face  would  be  something at the saying that he would be beside the common room 1
fire at the and hermione spent a long time going over plans for forcing any room 2
on  the  night  in if the worst came to the they to  but they hoped they have to 1
resort  to  that  would  skin in the life became even worse for harry within the 1
confines of skeeter had published her piece about the triwizard and it so much a 2
report  on the tournament as a highly colored life page had been given over to a 1
picture of the article on  had been all about the names of the beauxbatons and champions 1
champions  ad been squashed into the last line of the and cedric at  the article 1
had appeared ten days and harry still got a of his stomach every time he thought 2
about rita skeeter had him things that he remember ever saying in his let alone in 1
in i suppose i get my strength from my i know be very  see me sometimes at night 2
i  still cry about not to nothing will hurt me during the because watching over 1
but rita skeeter had gone even further than transforming his she had interviewed 2
other people about him harry has at last found love at his close colin says that 1
that rarely seen out of the company of one hermione a pretty  like is one of the 2
top  students  in  the  from the moment the article had harry had had to endure 1
ainly  it  at him as he passed and making sneering ain case you start crying in 1
hen  have  you  been one of the top students in the or a you and longbottom have 1
set up

up  harry  found  himself  shouting  as he wheeled around in the having had just 1
about just been crying my eyes out over off to do a bit was just dropped your it 2
was  harry  felt  the  color  rising in his he taking the quill good luck on she 1
really  hope  you do which left harry feeling extremely hermione had come in for 1
her  fair  share  of  unpleasantness  yelling  at  innocent in harry was full of 1
admiration for he  pansy parkinson had shrieked the first time she had come face 2
with hermione after article had was she judging against

against  hermione said in a dignified holding her head in the air and sniggering 1
slytherin  girls as though she hear ignore but harry ignore ron spoken to him at 1
all  since  he  harry  had  half hoped they would make things up during the were 1
forced  to pickle brains in but that had been the which seemed to have confirmed 1
belief that harry was all

all  hermione  was  furious with the pair of she went from  them to talk to each 1
but harry was he would talk to admitted that harry put his name in the goblet of 2
fire and

and  start  harry said his miss hermione said i know he misses you said miss but 1
this  was  a downright harry liked hermione very but she as  there was much hess 1
laughter  and a lot more hanging in was your best harry still mastered summoning 1
he  seemed  to  developed something of a block about and hermione insisted that 1
ould  they consequently spent a lot of time poring over books viktor krum was in 1
the  library  an  awful  lot  and he he or was he looking for things to help him 1
through  the  complained  about  krum  being  there  that he ever bothered them 1
iggling  girls  often  turned  up  to  spy  on him from behind oise not even she 1
muttered glaring at sharp only like him because they look twice at him if he do that 1
that onkyfaint thing said through gritted quite apart from liking to get quidditch 1
quidditch  terms it caused him another pang to imagine expression if he hermione 1
talking  about  it is a strange but when you are dreading and would give down it 1
has  a  disobliging  habit  of  speeding the days until by as though someone had 1
fixed  the clocks to work at double controlled panic was with him wherever he as 1

sweetshop  eating large think talking to move your lips so much please just take 1
off  your  cloak  for  a  no  going  to bother said behind  rita skeeter and her 1
photographer  friend  had  just  emerged  talking  in  low  they passed right by 1
hermione  without  hooking  at  the wall of honeydukes to stop rita skeeter from 1
hitting him when they were harry staying in the i bet coming to watch irst as he 2
said his stomach flooded with a wave of molten he he hermione discussed what was 2
coming  in  the first task he had want to think about said looking right through 1
harry toward the end of the we go and have a butterbeer in the three a bit you have 1
have  o  talk to she added correctly interpreting his  the three broomsticks was 1
mainly with hogwarts students but also with a variety of magical people harry rarely 1
rarely  upposed  that  as hogsmeade was the only wizard village a creatures like 1
who were not as adept as wizards at disguising  it was very hard to move through 2
crowds  in  the  in  case trod on which tended to lead to awkward harry edged a 1
able  in  the  corner while hermione went to buy on his  spotted who was sitting 1
with  and  lee  resisting  the  to  good hard poke in the back of the he finally 1
reached the table hermione joined him a moment later and slipped him a butterbeer 1
butterbeer  ook  like  such an sitting here on my she i brought o and she pulled 1
out  a notebook in which she had been keeping harry saw his and names at the top 1

watching  people in the all of them looked cheerful and ernie and  were swapping 1
chocolate frog cards at a nearby both of  badges on their right over by the door 2
he saw cho and ravenclaw she wearing a cedric badge this cheered up harry

harry what he have given to be one of these sitting around and

and  with  nothing to worry about but he imagined how it would to  name come out 1
of  the  goblet of he be wearing the for one ron would be sitting with the three 1
of  them  would be imagining what deadly dangerous task the school champions be 1
ave  been really hooking forward to watching them do whatever with everyone safe 1
in a seat at the back of the he wondered how the other champions were every time 2
he  had   had been surrounded by admirers and looking nervous but harry delacour 1
from  time  to  time  in  the she looked exactly as she and krum just sat in the 1
poring  over   harry  thought  of  and  the tense knot in his chest seemed to be 1
speaking  to  him  in  just over twelve for tonight was common room fire nothing 1
went  as  everything  else  had  done  aid  the back of enormous shaggy head had 1
mercifully  abandoned  emerged over the harry wondered why he spotted him at as 1
ut  standing up he saw that hagrid had been leaning talking hagrid had his usual 1
enormous tankard in front of but hip madam the pretty seem to think much of she was 1
was  looking  askance  at  moody  as she collected glasses from tables it was an 1
insult  to  her  mulled  but harry knew moody last defense against the dark arts 1
lesson that he preferred to all as it was so easy for dark wizards to poison an 1
an s harry he saw hagrid and moody get up to he then that hagrid see his magical 2
eye  on the corner where harry was he tapped hagrid in the small of the back to 1
uttered  something to and then the pair of them made their pub toward harry and 1
aid hagrid said smiling moody limped around the table and bent harry thought he was 1
was  ntil  he   harry stared at him in the large chunk missing from particularly 1
obvious  at  a  few moody your eye can you it can see through invisibility moody 1
said  come  in  useful   i  can tell hagrid was beaming down at harry harry knew 1
hagrid  see obviously told hagrid he was hagrid now bent down on the notebook as 1
and said in a whisper so low that only hear tonight at midnight at me wear that 1
that traightening hagrid said ter see and  moody followed does hagrid want me to 2
meet him at harry very said looking wonder what up i know whether you should she 2
looked nervously around and might make you

you  it  was  true  that  going down to at midnight would mean cutting very fine 1
hermione  suggested sending hedwig down to to tell go assuming she would consent 1
to take the of course thought

thought  better  just to be quick at whatever hagrid wanted him he  might hagrid 1
had  never  asked  harry  to  visit him so late at half past eleven that who had 1
pretended to go up to invisibility cloak back over himself and crept back downstairs 1
downstairs few people were still in the creevey brothers had managed to  support 2
cedric  badges  and were trying to bewitch them to harry so all they had managed 1
to  do  was  get the stuck potter harry crept past them to the portrait hole and 1
waited  a keeping an eye on his then hermione opened the fat lady had he slipped 1
past  her  with  a whispered and set off the  the grounds were very harry walked 1
down the lawn toward in the inside of the enormous beauxbatons carriage was also 2
lit  hear  madame maxime talking inside it as he knocked on front hagrid opening 1
the door and looking said slipping inside the cabin and pulling the cloak off

another giant dog off a in with keep keep yerself covered with that said take he 2
like   i  stay got to be back up at the castle by one  but hagrid he was opening 1
the  cabin  door and striding off  harry hurried to follow and to his great that 1

the  madame  maxime  opened she was wearing a silk shawl wrapped she smiled when 1
she saw

closed  the  door  behind  hagrid  offered  her  around  the edge of the paddock 1
containing  madame  giant  totally  running to keep up with had hagrid wanted to 1
show him he could see her any old time he she exactly hard to but it seemed that 2
madame  maxime  was  in  for the same treat  she said is it you are taking enjoy 1
said  hagrid  trust go anyone i showed not ter course said madame fluttering her 1
long  black  and  still  they  harry  getting  more and more irritated as he in 1
hecking  his  watch every now and hagrid had some scheme  might make him miss if 1
they  get  there  he  was  going  to   back to the and leave hagrid to enjoy his 1
moonlit stroll

stroll but then they had walked so far around the perimeter of the the lake were 2
out  of  sight  heard  men were shouting up then a arsplitting hagrid led madame 1
maxime  around a clump of trees and to  alongside them a split he thought he was 1
seeing and men them then his mouth fell

fell  four  fully  dragons were rearing onto their hind legs inside an enclosure 1
fenced with thick planks of roaring and snorting shooting into the dark sky from 2
their fanged fifty feet on outstretched there was a one with pointed snapping and 1
and t the wizards on the a scaled green which was writhing and all its a red one 2
with  an  odd  fringe of fine gold its fire clouds into the and a gigantic black 1
more  than the  which was nearest to at least thirty seven or eight to each were 1
attempting to  on the chains connected to heavy leather straps around and looked 2
high  above  and saw the eyes of the black with a bulging with either fear or he 1
tell  it was making a a creeching back yelled a wizard near the straining on the 1
chain he  can shoot fire at a range of twenty you seen this horntail

horntail  it said hagrid no yelled another on the count of harry saw each of the 1
dragon keepers pull out his  they shouted in and the stunning spells shot into the 1
the  ursting  in  showers  of  stars on the scaly hides harry watched the dragon 1
nearest  to  them  teeter  on  its  stretched wide in a silent its nostrils were 1
suddenly of very it several tons of dragon hit the ground with a thud that harry 2
could  have  sworn  made  the  trees behind him the dragon keepers lowered their 1
wands and walked forward to  which was the size of a small they hurried to tighten 1
tighten  iron  which  they forced deep into the ground with their acloser hagrid 1
asked  madame  maxime  the pair of them moved up to the and harry the wizard who 1
had warned hagrid and harry realized who it charlie  he coming over to should be 2
okay  now put them out with a sleeping draft on the way thought it might be dark 1
and  the quiet like you they not happy at all  breeds you got said gazing at the 1
closest  the black with something chose to its eyes were still just harry could 1
leaming  yellow  beneath  its wrinkled black  is a hungarian said a common welsh 1
green  over  the  smaller  one  swedish that a chinese the charlie looked madame 1
maxime  was  strolling  away  around  the  gazing  at  the stunned know you were 1
bringing charlie champions supposed to know coming bound to tell her

her  thought  like  ter see shrugged still at the romantic said shaking his said 1
one fer each the is they gotta do

do get past i said be on hand if it gets extinguishing spells at the they wanted 2
nesting i know but i tell envy the one who gets the vicious its back as dangerous 1
dangerous  harlie  pointed  toward  the and harry saw spikes protruding along it 1
every  few  five of fellow keepers staggered up to the horntail at that  of huge 1
eggs  between  them  in  a they placed them at hagrid let out a moan of got them 1
said charlie then he said he was still gazing at the hope still fine after faced 2
this said charlie looking out over dare tell mum what got to do for the first already 1
already  aving  kittens about charlie imitated his anxious could enter that much 1
too  i  thought  they  were  all  i thought there  going to be an age she was in 1
floods  after  that  daily   cries  about  his  oh  bless i never  harry had had 1
trusting  to the fact that hagrid miss with of four dragons and madame maxime to 1
occupy he turned silently back to the  he know whether he was glad seen what was 2
coming  or  this  the  first  shock was over maybe if seen the dragons for on he 1
would have passed out cold in front of the whole but he he was going to be armed 2
with  his  wand  just felt like  a narrow strip of wood a and he had to get past 1
with  everyone harry sped skirting the edge of the he had just under fifteen the 1
fireside  and  talk  to  and he wanting to talk to someone than he did right now 1
without  he  ran  into something very harry fell his glasses clutching the cloak 1
around a voice

voice harry hastily checked that the cloak was covering him and hay very outline 2
of the wizard he had he recognized the it was said karkaroff very looking around 2
in  the  harry remained still and after a minute or karkaroff seemed to  sort of 1
he  was  looking around at waist as though to  crept back under the cover of the 1
trees and started dragons very slowly and very harry got to his feet and set off 1
off  ithout  making too much hurrying through the darkness back  he had no doubt 1
whatsoever  what  karkaroff was up he had find out what the first task was going 1
to he might and  maxime heading off around the forest together were hardly a and 2
now all karkaroff had to do was follow the sound of would know what was in store 2
for the by the looks of the only champion who would be facing the

the harry reached the slipped in through the front and began  he was very out of 2
but  he dare slow he had less than to get up to the he gasped at the fat who was 1
snoozing  in  her  frame in ortrait you say she muttered without opening her and 1
the  picture   forward  to  admit harry climbed the common room was fact that it 1
smelled quite hermione had not needed to set that he and sirius got harry pulled 2
off  the invisibility cloak and threw himself an the room was in the flames were 1
the only source of on a support cedric badges the creeveys had been trying to improve 1
improve hey now read potter really harry looked back into the and

and  head  was sitting in the if harry seen diggory do exactly the it would have 1
scared  him  out  of  his  his  face breaking the first smile he had worn for he 1
scrambled  out  of his down ou  sirius looked different from memory of when they 1
had  said  face  had  been gaunt and surrounded by a quantity of matted hair was 1
short  and  clean  face  was and he looked much the only photograph harry had of 1
which  had  been taken at the mind how are said sirius  for a harry tried to say 1
he do before he could stop he was talking more than talked in days how no one he 1
he  ntered  the  tournament  of his own free how rita skeeter how he walk down a 1
corridor  without  being  sneered  at  about not believing and now just shown me 1
coming  in  the  first  and and a he finished sirius looked at eyes full of eyes 1
that had not yet lost the given them haunted look he had let harry talk himself into 1
into  but now he we can deal but get to that in a  minute got long broken into a 1
wizarding house to use the could be back at any there are things i need to warn you 1
you  aid  feeling  his  spirits slip a further few surely there be nothing worse 1
than dragons said he was a death you know what death eaters

eaters was he was in azkaban with but he got bet everything dumbledore wanted an 2
auror  at  hogwarts  this year keep an eye put him into azkaban in the first got 1
harry  said  slowly  brain  seemed  to be struggling to absorb  another piece of 1
shocking did they release did a deal with the ministry of said sirius said seen the 1
the  is and then he named he put a load of other people into in not very popular 1
in i can tell and since he got from  teaching the dark arts to every student who 2
passes through the durmstrang champion as

as said harry are you saying karkaroff put my name in the because if he a really 2
good  he seemed furious about he rom  know a good said he convinced the ministry 1
of magic to him been keeping an eye on the daily and the rest of the said harry 1
harry reading between the lines of that skeeter article last the night before he 2
started  at  i  know  she says it was said seeing harry about to i think i think 1
someone  tried stop him from getting to i think someone knew their job would be 1
ith  him  and  no going to look into it too heard intruders too but that mean he 1
still spot the real moody was the ministry ever what are you said harry s trying 2
to  kill but irius  been nearing some very strange he said death eaters seem bit 1
more  active  than  usual they showed themselves at the someone set off the dark 1
and  then  you  hear  about that ministry  witch gone aid she disappeared in and 1
definitely where voldemort was rumored be and she would have known the triwizard 2
tournament was  not very likely have walked straight into is said  i knew bertha 2
said sirius was at hogwarts when i a few years above your dad and and she was an 2
very  but  no  at  agood say be very easy to lure into a so voldemort could have 1
found out about the said that what you you think karkaroff might be here on his 1
his  said  sirius  just  karkaroff  strike  me as the type  go back to voldemort 1
unless  he knew voldemort was enough whoever put your name in that goblet did it 1
for  a  and  i  would be a very good way to attack you and make it hike a really 1
good  plan  from  where said harry grinning  just have to stand back and let the 1
dragons  do  their   said  speaking very quickly a  be tempted to try a stunning 1
spell are strong and too  out by a single you need about half a dozen wizards at 1
at i i just said  you can do it said is and a simple all you just but harry held 2
up  a  hand  to silence his heart suddenly as it  he could hear footsteps coming 1
down  the  spiral  staircase behind  he hissed at someone harry scrambled to his 1
hiding  the  fire  someone saw face they would raise an almighty uproar ministry 1
would  get  in  would  be questioned about whereabouts harry heard a tiny in the 1
fire  behind  him  and knew had bottom of the spiral who had decided to go for a 1
stroll  at  and stopped sirius from telling him how to get past a it was dressed 1
in his maroon paisley ron stopped dead the

the and looked were you talking he  that got to do with harry are you doing down 2
here  at  this  f  just  wondered where you ron broke going back to thought come 1
nosing  did harry he knew that ron had no idea what walked in knew he done it on 1
but  he care this moment he hated everything about right down to the several of 1
eneath his pajama about said his face reddening with realized you want to be let 2
you  get  on  with  practicing  for  your next in harry seized one of the potter 1
really stinks badges off as hard as he across the it hit ron on the forehead and 1
and  you  harry  for  you  to  wear on you might even have a scar if what you he 1
strode  across  the  room  toward  the he half expected ron to have liked ron to 1
throw  a  punch  at but ron just stood in having stormed lay awake in bed fuming 1
for  a long time and  him come up to chapter twenty  the first task harry got up 1
on  sunday  morning and dressed so inattentively that  realized he was trying to 1
pull  his  hat  onto  his  foot  of his his clothes on the right parts of his he 1
hurried off to  gryffindor table in the great where she was eating with to harry 2
waited  until  hermione  had swallowed her last of  her out onto the he told her 1
all  about  the  and about sirius  while they took another long walk around the 1
larmed  as  she  was by warnings about hermione still thought that  dragons were 1
the  more  pressing  just try and keep you alive until tuesday she said then can 1
worry  about  they  walked  three  times  around the trying all the way to would 1
subdue a nothing whatsoever occurred to so they retired  harry pulled down every 2
book  he could find on and of work searching through the large  by treating this 1
is  no  this  is  for  nutters  like  hagrid who want to keep them are extremely 1
difficult to owing to the ancient magic  which none but the most powerful spells 2
can but sirius a would do try some simple said throwing aside men who love dragons 1
dragons  too  he returned to the table with a pile of set them and began each in 1
hermione  whispering  nonstop  at  his  there  are  switching  but  the point of 1
switching unless you its fangs for or something that would make it less the

the  book not much is going to get through a say transfigure but that you really 1
got  a  i doubt even professor unless supposed to put the spell on maybe to give 1
yourself extra  simple i we done any of those in i only know about been doing practice 1
practice harry through gritted you shut up for a i m trying to

to  but  all that when hermione fell was that brain filled with blank which seem 1
to  allow  room for he stared hopelessly down  index of basic hexes for the busy 1
and  instant but had that would probably increase a horn just what he to give it 1
an  extra  back why he read on his stupid said hermione irritably as viktor krum 1
slouched cast a surly look over at the pair of  distant corner with a pile of go 2
back  to  the common be here in a twittering and sure as they left the a gang of 1
girls  tiptoed past wearing a bulgaria scarf tied around her  harry barely slept 1
that  when  he awoke on monday he for the first time ever just running away from 1
but as he the breakfast and thought about what leaving the castle would he knew 1
knew it was the only place he had ever been he supposed he his parents but he remember 1
remember  the  knowledge  that  he  would rather be here and facing a drive with 1
dudley  was good to it made him feel slightly with difficulty throat working too 1
and  as  he and hermione got cedric diggory leaving the hufflepuff  cedric still 1
know  about  the  the only champion who if in thinking that maxime and karkaroff 1
would have told fleur  see you in the harry coming to his decision as he  cedric 2
leaving  the  catch you be the about to ring catch you by the time harry reached 1
the  bottom  of the marble cedric at with a load of harry want to talk to cedric 1
in  front among those who had been quoting rita article at him every he followed 1
cedric  at a distance and saw that he was toward  harry an pausing at a distance 1
from he pulled out his and

and  bag  and  books  spilled  out  of it onto the several bottles  of ink  said 1
cedric  in an exasperated voice as his friends bent flitwick go this was exactly 1
what  harry had been hoping he slipped waited until friends had disappeared into 1
their  and hurried which was now empty of everyone but himself and  said picking 1
up  a  copy  of  a  guide to advanced that was splattered with bag just and said 1
first task is

is  said looking said speaking in case professor flitwick came out to see cedric 1
had  got  got  one for each of and got to get cedric stared at harry saw some of 1
the panic been feeling  flickering in gray you cedric said in a hushed said seen 1
seen how did you find not supposed to said harry quickly knew hagrid would be in 2
trouble  if  he  not the only one who fleur and krum will know by now  karkaroff 1
both saw the dragons cedric straightened his arms full of inky and his ripped bag 1
bag  dangling off one he stared at and there was a almost is are you telling he 1
arry looked at him in he was sure cedric have asked that  the dragons harry have 2
let his worst enemy face those perhaps malfoy or  he said to all know on an 2
even  cedric  was  still  hooking at him in a slightly suspicious clunking noise 1
behind he turned around and saw moody from

from with he off you harry stared apprehensively at had he overheard supposed to 2
be in herbology  mind in my harry followed wondering what was going to happen to 2
him  to  know  how found out about the would moody go to and  or just turn harry 1
into  a  it  might  be easier to get past harry thought be much less easy to see 1
from  a  height he followed moody into his moody closed the door his magical eye 1
fixed upon him as well as the normal was a very decent thing you just moody said 1
said arry know what to this the reaction he had expected  said and harry looking 1
looking  he  had visited this office under two of its previous in walls had been 1
plastered  with  winking  pictures  of  professor  lupin had lived you were more 1
likely to come across a of  dark creature he had procured for them to study in of 1
of umber of exceptionally odd objects that harry supposed had had been an on his 2
desk stood what looked hike a glass spinning harry it once as a because he owned 2
one  though  it  was much smaller in the corner on a small table stood an object 1
that  an  golden  television  it was humming what appeared to be a hung opposite 1
harry  on  the  but it was not reflecting the shadowy around inside none of them 1
clearly  in   my  dark  do  s  aid  who was watching harry harry pointing at the 1
squiggly golden

in every direction lying about why they homework been humming ever since i got i 2

than kid he added in a the mirror my see them out skulking not really in trouble 2
until  i  see the whites of their when i open my  he let out a harsh and pointed 1
to the large trunk under  keyholes in a harry wondered what was in until next him 1
him sharply back to  found out about the have  harry been afraid of this he told 2
and  he certainly going to tell that hagrid had broken the all said sitting down 1
and  stretching  out  his  wooden  leg with  a traditional part of the triwizard 1
tournament  and  always  said  harry  was  sort  of  accident that i found moody 1
accusing  been  telling  dumbledore from the he  can be as as he but you can bet 1
old  karkaroff  and have told their champions everything they they want to they 1
ike  to prove only moody gave another harsh and his magical eye swiveled so feel 1
queasy  to  watch  got  any ideas how going to get past your dragon said aid not 1
going  to tell said moody show just going to give you some general and the first 1
bit is to got said before he could stop growled got strengths if i say got think 2
what  are you best harry tried to what was he best that was really he said a fat 1
lot of said staring at him very his magical eye barely moving  a damn good flier 2
from what harry stared at not allowed a only got my second piece of general said 2
moody  interrupting to use a  simple spell that will enable you to get what you 1
arry  looked at him what did he whispered them not that and it he was best at he 1
needed  to  pass the dragon in he needed his and for his he needed harry when he 1
had  sped  into greenhouse three minutes ahurried apology to professor sprout as 1

over  the top of the quivering flutterby bush she was ineed to learn how to do a 1
summoning charm properly by and so they they have but headed for a free where harry 1
harry  ried  with  all  his  might to make various objects fly across having the 1
books and quills kept losing heart halfway across

some  try he wanted to skip divination to keep but hermione refused to and there 1

lesson telling everyone with relation to saturn at that moment meant that people 1
people iolent said harry his temper getting the better of as long as not i want to 1
to  on looked for a moment as though he was going to he certainly the first time 1
in  but  harry was still feeling too toward rest of the lesson trying to attract 1
small  objects  toward  managed  to make a fly zoom straight into his though he 1
rowess  at  summoning  charms  the fly was just he forced down some dinner after 1
then returned to the empty using the invisibility cloak to avoid the they kept until 1
until  they  would  have  stayed but peeves turned up pretending to harry wanted 1
things thrown at started chucking chairs across left in a hurry before the noise 2
attracted and went back which was now mercifully  at two in the harry stood near 2

better  get  some  going to need harry had been focusing so hard on learning the 1
summoning  of  his blind panic had heft it returned in full on the atmosphere in 1
the school was one of great tension and giving all the students time to get down 2
to  the  enclosure  of  they  yet  know  what  they would find  harry felt oddly 1
separate from everyone around whether they luck or hissing have a box of tissues 2
as  he it was nervousness so advanced that he wondered whether he just lose his 1

feeling  the  in face working rather as though they had forgotten how to do said 1
bagman  looking  around  at  come  make yourself at bagman looked somehow like a 1
slightly  overblown cartoon amid faced he was wearing his old wasp robes now all 1
here  to  fill you said bagman the audience has going to be offering each of you 1
this held up a small of and shook it at them which you will each select a small of 1
of  to  there  are  different  you  and  i have to tell you else your task is to 1
collect  the  golden harry glanced cedric had nodded to show that he understood 1
nd  then  started  pacing around the tent he looked slightly  reacted at perhaps 1
they  thought  they  might  be  sick  if  was  certainly  how  harry  but at had 1
volunteered  for and in no time at hundreds upon hundreds of pairs of feet their 1
owners  talking  harry felt as separate from the crowd they were a different and 1
then  seemed  like  about a second to was opening the neck of the purple silk he 1
offering  it to fleur she put a shaking hand inside the bag and drew out a of it 1
had  the  number  two  around  its  neck  and  harry by the sign of but rather a 1
determined  that  he had been madame told her what was the same held true for he 1
pulled  out the scarlet chinese around its he even just sat back down and stared 1
at the cedric put his hand into the and out came the swedish the

the  number  one  tied  around its knowing what was harry put his pulled out the 1
hungarian  and  the number it stretched its at and bared its minuscule there you 1
said  have each pulled out the dragon you will the numbers refer to the order in 1
which  you  are to take going to have to leave you in a because just go out into 1
the  enclosure  when you hear a all could uick said harry and he got up and went 1
out  of  the tent who walked him a short distance into the and then turned to a 1
xpression on his all anything i can get aid  a said lowering his voice i mind sharing 1
sharing  few if like you i bagman lowering his voice still the underdog anything 1
i can do to said harry so quickly he knew he had sounded know what going

wondering  e  had  ever  been less got a plan worked i awhistle had blown got to 1
said  bagman  in  and  he  hurried  harry walked back to the tent and saw cedric 1
emerging from to wish him luck as he walked but all that came out of his a harry 2
went  back  inside  to  fleur  and seconds they heard the which meant cedric had 1
entered  the  enclosure  and  was  now the  counterpart of his it was worse than 1
harry  could  ever have sitting there and the gasped like a single as cedric did 1
whatever he was doing to get past the swedish krum was still staring at taken to 2
retracing  around  and  around  the and commentary made everything much horrible 1
pictures formed in mind as he narrow miss very taking this move it

it and after about fifteen harry heard the deafening roar that cedric had gotten 2
past  his dragon and captured the golden good bagman was now the marks from the 1
but  he  shout  out the harry supposed the judges were them showing them to the 1
hree to bagman yelled as the whistle blew if you

you  fleur was trembling from head to harry felt more warmly her far as she heft 1
the  tent  with  her  head  held high and her were left at opposite sides of the 1
avoiding  each  the  same  process  started  not  sure that was they could hear 1
houting  careful  good  i thought had it ten minutes harry heard the crowd erupt 1
into  applause  once been successful a while marks were being more for the 1
the here comes cried and krum slouched leaving harry quite

quite  he  felt  much  more  aware  of  his body than very aware and his fingers 1
tingling  with yet at the same he seemed seeing the walls of the and hearing the 1
as  though  from  bagman was and harry heard the chinese fireball emit a roaring 1
while  the  crowd  drew  its  collective some nerve showing and got the applause 1
shattered  the  wintery air like breaking krum had be turn any he stood noticing 1
dimly  that  his  legs seemed to be made then he heard the whistle he walked out 1
through the entrance into a crescendo inside and now he was walking past the nclosure 1
nclosure  e  saw everything in front of him as though it was a very hundreds and 1
hundreds  of  faces  staring down at him from that  since last stood on this and 1
there  was  the  at  the other end crouched low over her clutch of her wings her 1
yellow  eyes   black  thrashing  her spiked heaving gouge marks in the  hard the 1
crowd  was  making a great deal of but whether or know or it was time to do what 1
he had to to focus upon the thing that was his only he raised his he harry every 2
fiber  of  him  if  it  if  it  he seemed to be looking at everything around him 1
through some like a heat which made the enclosure and the hundreds

hundreds  and  then  he  heard  speeding through the air behind he and  hurtling 1
toward him around the edge of the soaring into  in midair beside waiting for him 2
to the crowd was bagman was shouting but ears were not working properly istening 1
istening he swung his leg over the broom and kicked off from the something miraculous 1
miraculous  s  he soared as the wind rushed through his as the pinpnicks and the 1
horntail  shrank  to the size of a he that had heft not only the ground but also 1
his he was back this was just another quidditch that was just another quidditch 1
quidditch orntail was just another ugly opposing he looked down at the clutch of 2
eggs and spotted the colored residing safely between the front harry told

told he the head followed he knew what it was going to do of  the dive just in a 2
jet  of  fire  had been released exactly swerved but harry that was no more than 1
dodging  a   he  can  yelled bagman as the crowd shrieked and you watching harry 1
soared higher in a the horntail was still following his on its long neck he kept 2
this it would be nicely dizzy

dizzy would be breathing fire again  harry plummeted just as the horntail opened 2
its  but  this he  missed the but the tail came whipping up to meet him and  one 1
of  the  long spikes grazed his ripping his robes he could feel it he could hear 1
screaming  and  groans from the  seem to be now he zoomed around the back of the 1
and a

a  the  horntail  seem  to  want  to  take she was too protective of writhed and 1
furling and unfurling her wings and keeping those she was afraid to move too far 2
from  but  he had to her never get near the trick was to do it he began to first 1
this  then  the  not  near  enough to make her him but still posing a sufficient 1
threat  to  ensure  she kept her this way and watching him out of those vertical 1
her fangs he flew the head rose with her neck now stretched to its  still hike a 2
snake  before  its harry rose a few more and she let out a roar of he was a  she 1
was longing to her tail thrashed but he was too to into the which he her jaws opened 1
opened  arry  swerving tantalizingly above come and get up  you get and then she 1
spreading  her  leathery  wings  at as wide as a small airplane harry before the 1
dragon knew what he had or disappeared he was speeding toward the ground as fast 2
as  he unprotected by her clawed front legs had taken his hands olden and with a 1
huge spurt of he was he was soaring out safely under his uninjured and it was as 2
though  somebody  had  up the first he became properly aware of the noise of and 1
applauding  as  loudly  as the irish supporters at the at bagman was you look at 1
our  youngest champion is quickest to get his this is going to shorten the odds 1
arry  saw  the  dragon keepers rushing forward to subdue the at to the professor 1

the  real  eggs  took  marks off for he supposed to do ron drew breath as he and 1
harry reached the edge of the

the been taken harry could see where the five judges were at raised seats draped 2
in  marks  out  of ten from each ron and harry squinting up the judge maxime her 1

ron  snatched  pigwidgeon out of the air and him while harry attached the letter 1
to  his no way any of the other tasks are going to be that how ron went on as he 1
carried  pigwidgeon to the know i reckon his harry knew that ron was only saying 1

boxes hagrid had brought all

appreciate  being forced into boxes and nailed hagrid was soon while the skrewts 1
rampaged  around  the  pumpkin now strewn with the of  the most of the class and 1
goyle  in  the  lead  fled  into   cabin  through  the  back door and barricaded 1
themselves and were among those who remained outside trying to help they and tie 2

any  the  we  want  ron shouted angrily as he and harry backed into the of still 1
holding  the  skrewt off with their this does look like rita skeeter was leaning 1
on  garden looking in at the athick magenta cloak with a furry purple collar and 1
her  was  er  hagrid  launched  himself  forward  on top of the skrewt that was 1

creatures  she  beaming  still  more runted said apparently full of lively never 1
heard  of  them where  do they come harry noticed a dull red flush rising up out 1
of wild black where had hagrid got the skrewts who seemed to be along  said 2

skeeter  so  he  had  to  stand and watch in as made arrangements to meet in the 1
three  broomsticks  for a then the bell rang up at the signaling the end of the 1
ita  skeeter  called  merrily  to  him  as  he  set  off  with ron friday  twist 1
everything  he harry said under his as long as he import those skrewts illegally 1
or  said  they looked at one another was exactly the sort of thing been in loads 1
of  trouble and dumbledores never sacked said that can happen is have to get rid 1
of  the  did  i  say meant harry and hermione feeling slightly more went off to 1
harry  thoroughly enjoyed double divination that they were star and but now that 1
he  and  ron were friends once the whole funny professor who had been so pleased 1
with  the  pair  been predicting their own horrific quickly became irritated as 1

with a sense of would  now starting on a chocolate recognize a joke if it danced 1
danced ront of him wearing tea hapter the unexpected task will you pay professor 2
irritated voice cracked like a whip through the on and harry and ron both jumped 2
and  looked  it  was  the end of the they had finished their the guinea changing 1
into  guinea  pigs  had been shut away in a large still had they had copied down 1
their homework from the  with the ways in which transforming spells must be when 1
when erforming the bell was due to ring at any and harry and who had been having 2
a  sword fight with a couple of fred back of the looked ron holding a tin parrot 1
and a rubber that potter and weasley have been kind enough to act said

said  with  an  angry  look at the pair of them as the head fell silently to the 1
floor  beak  had  severed  it  moments  to  say  to you yule ball is approaching 1
traditional  part  of  the  triwizard  opportunity  for us to socialize with our 1
foreign the ball will be years and above you may invite a younger student if you 1
you  lavender  brown let out a shrill parvati patil nudged  working furiously as 1
she  too  fought  not to they both at mcgonagall ignored which harry thought was 1
distinctly  as  she nd robes will be professor mcgonagall the ball will start on 1
christmas  finishing  at  midnight  in the great now professor mcgonagall stared 1
deliberately around the yule ball is of course a chance for us all to our isapproving 1
isapproving  avender  giggled harder than with her hand pressed hard harry could 1
see what was funny this professor with her hair a looked as though she had never 2
let her hair down in any that does not professor mcgonagall went we will be relaxing 1
relaxing  tandards  of  behavior we expect from hogwarts i will be a  gryffindor 1
student  embarrasses  the school in any the bell and there was the usual scuffle 1
of activity as  swung them onto their professor mcgonagall called above the if you 1
you  ssuming  this  had something to do with his headless rubber gloomily to the 1
professor mcgonagall waited until the rest  and then the champions and their partners 1
partners aid profesor mcgonagall looked suspiciously at as though she thought 2
he  partners  for  the yule she said dance insides seemed to curl up and he felt 1
himself  going  he said you said professor mcgonagall what telling the champions 1
and their partners open the  harry had a sudden mental image of himself in a top 2
hat  sort  of  frilly  dress  aunt  petunia  always wore to uncle not he is said 1
professor mcgonagall are a hogwarts and you will do what is expected of you as a 2
representative of so

so  heard  said  professor  mcgonagall in a very final sort of aweek harry would 1
have  said  finding  a partner for a be to taking on a hungarian but now that he 1
had done the and  prospect of asking a girl to the he thought rather have  harry 2
had  never  known  so  many  people  to put their names he always of because the 1
alternative  was  usually  going  back  but  he had always been very much in the 1
minority before

before  everyone in the fourth year and above seemed to be and obsessed with the 1
coming ball at least all the girls and  hogwarts suddenly seemed to he had never 2
quite noticed that whispering in the girls shrieking with laughter as boys passed 1
passed  comparing notes on what they were going to wear on  do they have to move 1
in  harry asked ron as a dozen sniggering and staring at you supposed to get one 1
on their

their  ron  any idea who going to  harry he knew perfectly well whom like to but 1
working  up was something cho was a year older than he she was she quidditch and 1
she  was also very ron seemed to know what was going on inside not going to have 1
any  a  just  beaten  a  hungarian i bet be queuing up to go with  in tribute to 1
their  recently  repaired  ron  had  kept  the  a  to he turned out to be quite 1
hufflepuff girl to whom harry had never spoken in his him to go to the ball with 2
her the very next harry was  even stopped to consider the the girl walked off rather 1
rather  ndure  and  taunts  about  her all through history of the two more girls 1
asked a second year and his a fifth year who  though she might knock him out if he 1
he  as  quite said ron after stopped was a foot taller than said still what look 1
like trying to dance with words about krum kept coming back to only like him because 1
because  harry  doubted  very much if any of the girls who had asked  would have 1
wanted  to  go to the ball with him if he a wondered if this would bother him if 1
cho  asked  on the harry had to admit that even with the prospect of before life 1
had  definitely  improved since he had got through the attracting nearly as much 1
unpleasantness in the corridors which to do with cedric had an idea cedric might 2
have  told  the gratitude for about the there seemed to be fewer support cedric 1
badges  around  draco of was still quoting rita article to him at every possible 1
but  he  was  getting  fewer and fewer out to heighten feeling of no story about 1
hagrid had appeared

him  how  his interview with rita skeeter had the last care of magical creatures 1
lesson  of  the  to  their  up  on direct contact with the skrewts and they were 1

feeling  himself  going  red  hagrid  pursue  the  the  last week of term became 1
increasingly  boisterous  as  it   ball were flying though harry believe half of 1
them  that dumbledore had bought eight hundred barrels of mulled mead from to be 1
that he had booked the weird exactly who or what the were harry never having had 2
access  to a but he deduced  wild excitement of those who had grown up listening 1
to  the  that  they were a very famous musical some of the like little professor 1
gave  up trying to their minds were so clearly he allowed them to play games and 1
spent  most  of  it talking to harry about the perfect harry had used during the 1
first  task of the triwizard other nothing would ever deflect professor for from 1
plowing  on  his  notes  on goblin rebellions binns let his own death stand they 1
supposed a small thing like christmas going to put how he could make even bloody 2
and  vicious  goblin  riots  bottom  professors  mcgonagall  and moody kept them 1
working  until  of  their  classes  and  of  would no sooner let them play adopt 1

hoping  very much that padma nose was dead hapter the yule ball despite the very 1
heavy  load of homework that the fourth years  harry was in no mood to work when 1
term  and  spent  the  week  enjoying  himself  as  fully as possible along with 1
everyone  tower  crowded now than during it seemed to have shrunk slightly being 1
so much rowdier than fred and george had had a great and for the first couple of 2
days of the people kept into the before all the gryffindors had learned to treat 2
food offered them with extreme in case it had a canary cream in  george confided 2
to  harry  that he and fred were now harry made a mental note never to accept so 1
much  as  a and still forgotten dudley and the snow was falling thickly upon the 1
castle and its grounds carriage looked like a frosted pumpkin next to the iced was 1

fleur  delacour  seemed  to  to  complain  is  too all zis they heard her saying 1
grumpily as they hall behind her one evening skulking behind keen not to not fit 2

thinks  a  lot  of  that  are  you going to the ball said he kept springing this 1
question  on  hoping  to  startle  her into a she least expected hermione merely 1
frowned  and  not telling just make fun of said behind not telling me asked that 1

alfoys  professor  malfoy went pale and jumped looking wildly around for but he 1
at  the staff finishing his  little said hermione and and ron went up the marble 1
staircase laughing  said looking sideways at suddenly teeth about she ust course 2
they are you expect me to keep those fangs idifferent to how they were before he 2
put that hex on straight and

and  hermione  suddenly smiled very and harry noticed it it was  different smile 1
from  the  one he when i went up to madam pomfrey to get them she held up  me to 1
stop  her  when  they  were back to how they normally carry on a she smiled even 1
more  and  dad be too been trying to persuade them to let me shrink them for but 1

little feathery ron hurrying up the stairs and up  bring letters to the you hang 2
around showing  pigwidgeon hooted his head protruding over the girls all ery ron 2
snapped  at  waving  the  fist holding who hooted happily than ever as he soared 1
through the ron added in as the girls scuttled away looking he pulled reply off 1
off  arry pocketed and they hurried back to gryffindor tower to  everyone in the 1
common  room  was  much too busy in letting  observe what anyone else was up and 1
hermione sat apart from dark window that was gradually filling up with and harry 2
read ear congratulations on getting past the whoever put your name in be feeling 2
too happy right now i was going to suggest a as  are its weakest point what krum 2
hermione whispered your

involving  a  couple  of   very  violent  harry awoke very suddenly on christmas 1
wondering  what  had  to  he  opened his and saw something with very green eyes 1
staring back at him in the so close they were nose

jumping  backward  with  his long fingers over his is only wanting to wish harry 1
potter  and  bring  him  harry potter did say dobby could come and see him  said 1
still  breathing rather faster than while his heart  prod me or something in all 1
bend  over  me like harry pulled back the curtains around his took his from  and 1
put them his yell had awoken and all of them were through the gaps in their own and 1
and  ttacking  seamus  asked just harry back to  said spotting the large pile at 1
the  foot  of  his  and  neville decided that now they were awake they might as 1
harry turned back to who was now standing nervously next looking worried that he 2
had upset there was a christmas bauble his tea dobby give harry potter his he squeaked 1
squeaked ou said got something for you  it was a he bought anything for dobby at 2
but  he  quickly pulled out a particularly knobbly pair of they were his mustard 1

selfless nly said who had gone slightly pink around the though he rather pleased 2
all the harry he had just opened a chudley cannon he jammed it onto his where it 2
clashed  horribly   dobby  now  handed  harry  a small which turned out to be is 1

and  he  pulled  them  causing eyes to leak with happiness must go we is already 1
making  christmas  dinner in the and he hurried out of the waving to ron and the 1
others as other presents were much more satisfactory than odd socks

socks exception of the which consisted of a single an low supposed they too were 2

bulging bag of a handy penknife with attachments to unlock any lock and undo any 2

nd  neville  changed into their dress robes up in their all of them looking very 1
but  none  as much as who surveyed in long mirror in the corner with an appalled 1
look  on his was fact that his robes looked more like a dress than anything them 1
look  more he used a severing charm on the ruff and it least he was now although 1
he  done a very neat and the  depressingly frayed as the boys set off still work 1
out  how  you  two got the girls in the muttered  said ron pulling stray threads 1
out  of  his the common room looked full of people wearing different of  mass of 1

watched  krum  and  hermione  draw  tonight in robes of bright purple with large 1
yellow was as of the and madame who had changed her usual uniform a flowing gown 2
of  lavender  was applauding them but harry  was not the fifth seat at the table 1

surrounded  by  ornamental  and  large  stone  harry  could hear splashing which 1
sounded like a here and people sitting on carved he and ron set off along one of 2

a  girl  ran  past  ten  from hufflepuff as a boy went rushing after what are he 1
catching  sight  of harry and ron on the path harry  slightly discomposed to see 1
them  standing  his  hand  went  began  winding  it around his re ron told snape 1

behind  karkaroff  hurried  away after harry and ron down got karkaroff all ron 1
since when have he and snape been on said harry

harry  they  had  reached  a  large  stone  reindeer over which tall the shadowy 1
outlines  of two enormous people were visible watching the water in the and then 1
harry heard hagrid isaw i he was in an oddly husky harry and ron this sound like 2
the  sort  of  scene  they  harry looked back up the and saw fleur delacour and 1
tanding in a rosebush he tapped ron on the shoulder and toward meaning that they 2
could  easily sneak off that way davies looked very busy to but eyes widening in 1
horror  at his head and pulled harry deeper into the shadows behind did you said 1
madame a purr in her low harry definitely want to listen to he knew hagrid would 2
to  situation  like  this  certainly  would it had been possible in his ears and 1
hummed  but  that really an instead he to himself in a beetle crawling along the 1
stone but the  enough to block out next knew you were like was it yer mother or yer 1
yer  now  what you was my said hagrid was one the ones in i remember her too she 1
when  i was she really the maternal not in their is dunno what happened to might 1
be dead fer all

over the top of the he had never heard about his childhood dad was when she tiny 2
little  my  dad by the time i six i could lift him up put him on top the dresser 1
if he  deep voice madame maxime was apparently staring at the silvery raised but 2
he  after i started sorta had ter make me own way after dumbledore was a real e 1
agrid  pulled out a large spotted silk handkerchief and  enough what about which 1
side  you got it but madame maxime had suddenly got to her  is she said whatever 1
the  weather  was  it was nowhere near as her think i will go in said hagrid don 1
never  met another one  said madame her tone harry could have told hagrid it was 1
best not to he in his hoping against hope he it was no aid  dare shrieked madame 2
her  voice  exploded  through  the  peaceful like a behind harry heard fleur and 1
roger  fall out of been more insulted in my i big she stormed great multicolored 1
swarms  of  fairies rose into the  pushing aside hagrid was still sitting on the 1
staring  it to make out his after about a he stood up and strode not to  the but 1
off out into the dark grounds in the direction harry very quietly to  but ron

ron  said  looking  at  ron  looked around at his expression very serious you he 1
hagrid  being  arry  he  knew  from  the  look  ron was giving that he was once 1
gnorance  of  the  wizarding brought up by the there were many  wizards took for 1
granted that were revelations to but had with each successive he could tell that 2
most wizards would not upon finding out that one of their friends had a giantess 2
a   explain said ron fleur and roger davies had probably into a more private of 1
nd  ron  returned  to  the  great  parvati and padma were now at  whole crowd of 1
beauxbatons  and hermione was once more with ron sat down at a table far removed 1
from the dance  harry prompted the problem with ron struggled for not very he finished 1
finished arry nothing wrong with know there no wonder he keeps it ron shaking his 1
his  lways thought got in the way of a bad engorgement charm  like to mention it 1
matter  if  his  mother  was a said no one who knows him will know not said ron 1
just  like hagrid in their  like they just like everyone knows there any left 1
britain  happened  to  they were dying out and then loads got themselves 1
killed  by  supposed  to  be  giants  they hide out in mountains know who maxime 1
thinks harry watching madame maxime  sitting alone at the looking very she definitely 1
definitely  ig the only thing got bigger bones than her is a harry and ron spent 1
the  rest of the ball discussing in having any inclination to harry tried not to 1
watch  cho  and strong desire to kick when the weird sisters finished playing at 1
everyone gave applause and started to wend their way into the entrance many wish 2
that  the  ball could have gone on but harry was happy far as he was the evening 1
been  much  out in the entrance harry and ron saw hermione saying good went back 1
to  the  durmstrang  she gave ron a very cold marble staircase without harry and 1
ron followed but halfway harry heard someone calling

calling it was cedric harry could see cho waiting for him in the hall said harry 2
coldly as cedric ran up the stairs toward cedric looked as though he want to say 2
whatever  it  was in looking and continued to climb the cedric lowered his voice 1
as ron owe you one for me the you know that golden does yours wail when you open 1
open aid

aid take a

a a and the egg with and mull things over in the hot help you trust harry stared 2
at   you  cedric  the  fourth  door  to  the  left  of  that statue of boris the 1
bewildered on the fifth gotta go to say good

good  he  grinned at harry again and hurried back down the to  harry walked back 1
to  gryffindor  tower  that had been extremely would a bath help him to work out 1
what  the  wailing  egg  he trying to make harry look like a so cho would by the 1
fat lady and her friend vi were snoozing in the over to yell before he woke them 2
and  when  he they were extremely  he climbed into the common room and found ron 1
and  a  ten feet they were bellowing at each each scarlet in the if you like you 1
know  what  the  solution yelled her hair was coming down out of its elegant bun 1
and  her  face   ron yelled time a ask me before someone else and not as a last 1
ron  mouthed  soundlessly  like  a  goldfish  out  of water as on stormed up the 1
staircase  to ron turned to look at he looking just proves missed the oint harry 1
say  he  liked  being  back on speaking terms with ron too his mind right now he 1
somehow thought that hermione had the  than ron hapter rita scoop  everybody got 2
up  late on boxing the gryffindor common room it had been many yawns punctuating 1
the lazy hair was bushy she confessed to harry that she had used liberal amounts 2
of  for  the  way  too  much  bother  to  do  every  she said scratching purring 1
crookshanks  behind the ron and hermione seemed to have reached an unspoken not 1
they  were  being  quite  friendly  to  each  though oddly ron wasted no time in 1
telling hermione about the conversation they had maxime and but hermione seem to 2
find  the news that hagrid a nearly as shocking as ron ithought he must she knew 1
he be pure giant because about twenty feet but all this hysteria about they all be 1
be he same sort of prejudice that people have toward just

just  ron  looked  as though he would have liked to reply but another because he 1
contented himself with shaking his head

head it was time now to think of the homework they had neglected

neglected  everybody  seemed  to be feeling rather flat now that was except that 1
who was starting to feel slightly the trouble was that february the looked a lot 2
closer  from   and  he  still  done  anything about working out the clue inside 1
therefore  started taking the egg out of his trunk every he and listening hoping 1
that  this  time  it  would  make some he what the sound reminded him apart from 1
thirty musical else like he closed the shook it and opened it again to but it he 2
tried  asking  the  egg shouting over all the but  nothing he even threw the egg 1
across the room he really o harry had not forgotten the hint that cedric had given 1
given  oward cedric just now meant that he was keen not to take it seemed to him 1
that  if  cedric  had  really wanted to give a alot more had told cedric exactly 1
what was coming in the idea of a fair exchange had been to tell harry to take of 2
rubbishy  help  from  someone who kept walking down hand and so the first day of 1
the  new  term  and  harry set off to down  with and quills as but also with the 1
lurking  worry  as  though  he were carrying that around with him snow was still 1
thick  upon  the and the greenhouse windows were condensation so thick that they 1
see  out  of  them  in  nobody forward to care of magical creatures much in this 1
though  as  would  probably warm them up either by chasing or blasting off cabin 1
would  catch   when  they  arrived  at  hagrid they found an elderly witch with 1
cropped  gray  hair and a very prominent chin standing before the bell rang five 1
minutes  she barked at them as her through the said staring at name is professor 1
she said am your temporary care of  magical creatures  harry repeated is said professor 1
professor  oft and unpleasant laughter reached harrys he draco malfoy slytherins 1
were  joining  the  all of them looked and none  to see professor said professor 1
and  she  strode  off  around  the paddock where the beauxbatons horses were and 1
hermione followed back over their shoulders at all the curtains were was hagrid 1
hagrid  lone  and   wrong with harry hurrying to catch up with professor you she 1
said as though she thought he was being do said harry up with professor acted as 2
though  she  hear  she  led  them  past   where the huge beauxbatons horses were 1
huddled  against  the a the edge of the where a large and beautiful unicorn was 1
any of the girls at the sight of the so whispered lavender did she get supposed to 1

with its golden hooves and throwing back its  keep barked professor throwing out 2
an arm and catching harry  hard in the prefer the girls to the and approach with 1
with  ome  easy does she and the girls walked slowly forward toward the leaving 1
addock  the  moment  professor  was out of harry turned o reckons wrong with you 1

aid harry malfoy put his hand inside the pocket of his robes and you he to break 2

lying  to  anyone harry went back to afternoon with ron and unable to banish the 1
image  of  the  on   whiskery face as he had imagined harry winning the the  egg 1
weighed more heavily than ever on harrys conscience and  got into he had made up 2
his  mind  was time to shelve if  was worth hapter the egg and the eye harry had 1
no  idea  how  long a bath he would need to work out decided to do it at when he 1
would  be  able to take as much though he was to accept more favors from he also 1
decided to far fewer people were allowed in so it was much less he harry planned 2
his  excursion  because  he had been caught of  bounds by filch the caretaker in 1
the  middle  of the night the the invisibility cloak of be and as an added harry 1
thought  he  would  take  the marauders next to the was the aid to harry the map 1
showed  the  whole  of including its many  shortcuts and secret passageways most 1
important of it revealed castle as labeled moving around the so that harry would 1
would  orewarned if somebody was approaching the on thursday harry sneaked up to 1
put on the crept back just as he had done on the night when hagrid had shown him 1
him to this time it was ron who waited outside to give the fat ron climbing into 2
the  room  as harry crept out past it was awkward moving under the cloak because 1
harry  had  the arm and the map held in front of his nose with the the empty and 1
and by checking the map at strategic harry was run into anyone he wanted to when 2
he  reached  the  statue of awizard with his gloves on the wrong he located the 1
eaned  close to and muttered the just as cedric had told  the door creaked harry 1
slipped  bolted the door behind and invisibility looking  his immediate reaction 1
was  that it would be worth becoming a  this it was softly lit by a splendid and 1
everything was of white including what looked like an rectangular swimming pool 1
pool  iddle  of the about a hundred golden taps stood all around the differently 1
colored jewel set into its there was also a curtains hung at the a large pile of 2
fluffy  white  sat  single painting on the it featured a blonde mermaid was fast 1
asleep on a her long hair over her it fluttered

fluttered  harry  moved  looking  his footsteps echoing off the magnificent  the 1
bathroom  was  quite  keen though he was to try out a here he quite suppress the 1
feeling  that  cedric  might have been earth was this supposed to help solve the 1
mystery of the huffy the the and the egg at the side of the sized knelt down and 2
turned  on  a few of the he could tell at once that they carried different sorts 1
of  bath  though  it  bubble bath as harry had ever experienced one  bubbles the 1
size of another poured white foam so thick have supported his weight if cared to 2
test a third sent hovering over the surface of the harry amused himself for the 1
the  articularly enjoying the effect of one whose jet bounced off  when the deep 1
pool  was  full  of hot and which took a very  time considering its harry turned 1
off  all  the  pulled off his dressing and slid into the it was so deep that his 1
feet  barely touched the and he a  before swimming back to the side and treading 1
staring  at it was to swim in hot and foamy water with clouds of steam no stroke 1
of brilliance came to no sudden burst of  harry stretched out his lifted the egg 2
in his wet and screeching sound filled the echoing and reverberating off sounded 2
just as incomprehensible as if not more so with all worried that the sound would 2
attract wondering whether that plan making him jump so badly that he dropped the 2
which the bathroom someone try putting it in the if i were harry had swallowed a 2
considerable  amount of bubbles in he stood saw the ghost of a very girl sitting 1
on  top  of  one  of the moaning who was usually to be heard sobbing in the of 1
three  harry  said  in not wearing  the foam was so dense that this hardly 1
but  he  had  a nasty been spying on him from out of one of the taps ever since 1
losed my eyes when you got she blinking at him through her thick  been to see me 2
for  said bending his knees just to make absolutely sure myrtle see anything but 1
his not supposed to come into your am a

a  used  to said myrtle used to be in there all the this was though only because 1
and  hermione had found  toilets a convenient place to brew polyjuice potion in 1
im and ron into living replicas of crabbe and goyle for an the slytherin common 1
common got told off for going in said which was percy had  coming out of myrtles 2
thought  better  not come back after see said picking at a spot on her chin in a 1
morose  sort  try the egg in the what cedric diggory you been spying on him said 1
harry sneak up here in the evenings to watch the prefects take said rather never 2
come out to speak to anyone

anyone  said  harry  keep  your  eyes  he  made sure myrtle had her glasses well 1
covered before wrapping the towel firmly around his and going to retrieve he the 2
myrtle  peered  through  her  fingers  and  open  it under harry lowered the egg 1
beneath  the  foamy surface and opened  a gurgling song was coming out of a song 1
whose words he

he  need  to  put  your head under said who seemed to be thoroughly bossing him 1
harry took a great breath and slid under the surface on the he heard a chorus of 2
eerie voices singing to him in

in  seek  us  where our voices we cannot sing above the and while you re ponder 1
ove taken what sorely  an hour long have to and to recover what we but past an hourthe 1
hourthe oo it wont come harry let himself float back upward and broke the bubbly 2
his

his  said  seek us where our voices and if i need persuading i need to listen he 1
sank  back  beneath the it took three more underwater of the before harry had it 1
then  he trod water for a thinking and watched got to go and look for people who 1
use their voices above who could that

that  he  had  never  seen moaning myrtle so apart from the day potion had given 1
hermione  the  hairy  face and tail of a thinking the voices could only be heard 1
then it made sense  underwater he ran this theory past who smirked at thats what 2
diggory  she  lay  there  talking  to  himself  for ages ages and nearly all the 1
bubbles had  harry said what lives in the apart from the giant

giant all she sometimes go down sometimes have any if  someone flushes my toilet 2
when  not expecting  trying not to think about moaning myrtle zooming down a to 1
of  a  harry  does  anything  in there have a human hang  eyes had fallen on the 1
picture  of  the  snoozing  mermaid  there  merpeople  in are very she her thick 1
glasses  took  diggory  much  longer than and that was with her awake jerked her 1
head toward the an expression of great dislike on her glum face and showing off

off  said  harry  second  tasks  to go and find the merpeople in lake and but he 1
suddenly realized what he was and he felt the out though someone had just pulled 2
a plug in his he a very never had much dudley had had lessons in his but aunt and 1
and  no  doubt  hoping  that  harry  would  drown one bothered to give couple of 1
lengths  of  this bath were all very but that  merpeople would surely live right 1
at  the harry said am i supposed to at eyes filled with sudden tears she groping 1
in her robes for a aid  about breathing in front of she said and her voice echoed 1
echoed  the  i  when  i not for ages she buried her face in her handkerchief and 1
sniffed  harry   myrtle had always been about being but none of the bout he said 1
mean just very easy to forget said looking at him out of  swollen missed me even 2
when  i  was  took them hours and to  body i was sitting there waiting for olive 1
hornby  came  the you in here she professor dippet asked me to look for you  and 1
then  she  saw  my  she forget it until her dying i made followed her around and 1
reminded i i remember at her but harry he was thinking about the song taken what 2
you  ii sorely that sounded as though they were going to something he had to get 1
what were they going to of she went to the ministry of magic to stop me stalking 1
stalking  ome  back here and live in my  said harry a lot further on than i shut 1
your  eyes will etting  he retrieved the egg from the bottom of the climbed and 1
pajamas and dressing gown you come and visit me in my bathroom again moaning myrtle 1
myrtle  mournfully  as  harry picked up the invisibility  harry though privately 1
thinking  the  only  way be visiting bathroom again was if every other toilet in 1
the castle got for our she said and as harry put on the invisibility cloak he saw 1
saw  ack  up  the  out in the dark harry examined the marauders map to check the 1
dots belonging to filch and his were safely in  nothing else seemed to be moving 2
apart from though he was the room on the floor harry had taken his first step back 1
back omething else on the map caught his something distinctly peeves was not the 2
only thing that was a single dot was bottom corner but the dot labeled was bartemius 1
bartemius arry stared at the crouch was supposed to be too ill to yule ball what 2
was he sneaking into hogwarts at one in the

the  watched  closely  as the dot moved around and around the harry and then his 1
curiosity got the better of he turned  the opposite direction toward the nearest 2
he  was  going  to  harry walked down the stairs as quietly as though the faces 1
till  turned  curiously at the squeak of a the rustle of corridor pushed aside a 1
tapestry  about  halfway and proceeded ashortcut that would take him down two he 1
kept  glancing  wondering just seem in for crouch to be sneaking around somebody 1
office  this  late at and halfway down the not thinking about what he was not on 1
anything  but the peculiar behavior of harrys leg sank trick step neville always 1
forgot  to  he  gave an ungainly damp from the slipped from under his he lurched 1
forward  to  the  egg  fell  down  the  long staircase with a bang as loud as a 1
nvisibility  cloak  slipped snatched at and the marauder s map and slid down six 1
sunk in the step to above his he reach  the golden egg fell through the tapestry 2
at the bottom of the wailing loudly in the corridor harry pulled out his wand and 1
and arauder s to wipe it but it was too far away to reach pulling the cloak back 2
over himself harry straightened listening hard  up with almost immediately

immediately  it  was  the  unmistakable  hunting  cry  of filch the harry could 1
huffling  footsteps  coming nearer and his wheezy voice raised  this wake up the 1
whole  will  have have and what is footsteps there was a clink of metal on metal 1
and the had picked up the egg and closed harry stood very one magical any moment 2
filch  was going to pull aside the expecting to see and there would be no peeves 1
if he came up the he would and invisibility cloak or the map would show standing 1
standing xactly where he filch said quietly at the foot of the norris was obviously 1
obviously  ith him is a triwizard this belongs to a school  harry felt his heart 1
was  hammering very fast filch roared been he ripped back the tapestry and harry 1
saw  his pouchy face eyes staring up the dark and deserted are he said coming to 1
get gone and stolen a triwizard have you out of here for you pilfering

pilfering  filch  started to climb the his cat at his like so very like her were 1
fixed  directly  upon he had now to wonder whether the invisibility cloak worked 1
on  sick  watched filch drawing nearer and nearer in his old flannel to pull his 1
trapped  leg  but it merely sank a few more  going to spot the map or walk right 1
into  him  whats  going   filch stopped a few steps below harry and at the foot 1
erson who could make situation he was wearing a long gray

gray and he looked filch whispered threw this egg down the  snape climbed up the 2
stairs quickly and stopped beside convinced his loudly thumping heart would give 2
him away at said snape staring at the egg in peeves get into my  egg was in your 1

distinct  impression  she  could smell why had he filled that bath with so thing 1
said  filch  headmaster  will have to listen to me this peeves has been stealing 1
from  a  it might be my chance to get castle once and for all igive a damn about 1

limp  into  sight  through  the  narrow gap their  was wearing his old traveling 1
cloak  over  his nightshirt on is he growled up the snape and i heard said filch 1
at the throwing things around as usual then professor snape discovered into his off 1
off nape hissed to moody took a step closer to the foot of the harry saw moodys 1
moodys  nd onto  harrys heart gave a horrible moody could see through he see the 1
full strangeness of the snape in his filch clutching the and trapped in the stairs 1

was full of look forward to meeting you  in a dark corridor some dropped by the 1
the ith a stab of harry saw moody point at the marauders on  staircase six steps 2
below  as  snape and filch both turned to the he raised his arms under the cloak 1
and  waved  furiously at outhing snape had reached out for a horrible expression 1
of dawning on

on the map flew up into the slipped through snapes outstretched stairs into moodys 1
moodys  oody  said mine dropped it earlier  but black eyes were darting from the 1
egg  in  arms to the and harry could tell he was putting two and two as he said 1
said  moody  folding  up the map and pocketing  snape and he actually turned his 1
head and stared right  harry as though he could suddenly see egg is potters that 1
that  archment  belongs  to  i have seen it i recognize potter nvisibility snape 1
stretched  out  his  hands like a blind man and began to have sworn his nostrils 1
were  trying to sniff harry out harry trying to avoid snapes but any moment now 1
othing barked be happy to tell the headmaster how  quickly your mind jumped to harry 1
harry  nape  turned  again  to  look  at  his  hands  still inches rom that very 1
interested  to  know got it in for that said limping nearer still to the foot of 1
the  so  am very torchlight flickered across his mangled so that the and the his 1
looked  deeper  and  darker  than  snape  was  looking down at and harry see the 1
expression  on nobody moved or said then snape slowly lowered his merely said in 1
a voice of forced if potter was wandering

the  egg  as  though  it  were  his firstborn is evidence of the property of the 1
champion  he  stole  it  said  hand  it  snape swept downstairs and passed moody 1
without another a  noise to who stared blankly at harry for a few more following 2
her  still  breathing  very harry heard snape walking filch handed moody the egg 1
and  disappeared  from  view to my see dumbledore in the morning him what peeves 1
was up

up  a  door harry was left staring down at who placed his staff bottommost stair 1
and  started  to  climb  laboriously  toward  a  dull he said harry is this said 1
drawing  the  map out of his pocket and unfolding of said hoping moody was going 1
to  pull  him  out  of  the  his leg was really hurting moody staring at the his 1
magical eye going this is some quite harry his eyes were starting to water from the 1
the  professor  think  you  could  help me of moody took hold of harrys arms and 1
harrys  leg came free of climbed onto the one above moody was still gazing at he 1
said  by  any  to  see  who  broke into snapes  did on this i iharry was  moodys 1
magical  eye  whizzed over the entire surface of the e aid not here said his eye 1
still  whizzing  over the very he said nothing for almost a still staring at the 1
harry could meant something to moody and very much wanted to know it dared moody 2
scared him yet moody had just helped him avoid

avoid why reckon crouch wanted to look around snapes moodys magical eye left the 2
map and upon it was a  and harry had the impression that moody was sizing him or 2
how  much to tell it this moody muttered say old obsessed with catching dark but 1
nothing to barty he continued to stare at the harry was burning to know

know he said could this have anything to do maybe crouch thinks something going 1
going  aid  moody  harry  wondered  how  much  he  dare  he want moody to guess 1
nformation  outside  that  might  lead  to  tricky  questions  harry stuffs been 1
happening been in the daily the dark mark at the world and the death eaters and 1
and  oth  of mismatched eyes  a sharp he his magical eye roved back to the could 1
be thinking along those he said there have been  some funny rumors flying around 2
lately along by rita of a lot of people i a grim smile twisted his lopsided if one 1
one  hing i he more to himself than to and his magical eye corner of the a death 1
eater  who  walked harry stared at could moody possibly mean what harry he now i 1
want  to ask you a said moody in a more businesslike harrys heart he had thought 1
this was moody was going to ask this which was a very dubious magical object the 2
story of it  hands incriminated not only but his own fred and george  their last 2
defense  against the dark arts moody waved who braced himself borrow said he was 1
very fond of his but on the other he was relieved asking where got and there was 2
no doubt that he owed

owed  growled can make good use of this might be exactly what been looking come 1
hey  climbed  to the top of the stairs moody still the map atreasure the like of 1
which  he  had never seen they in where he stopped and looked up at ever thought 1
of a career as an said taken want to consider said nodding and looking at harry 1
harry  ndeed  incidentally  guessing  you werent just taking that egg  said been 1
working out the moody winked at his magical eye going haywire like a nighttime to 1
to ive you see you in the he went back into his staring down at the marauders map 1
map  ehind  harry walked slowly back to gryffindor lost in thought about what it 1
all why was crouch pretending to be if he could when he wanted what did he think 2
snape was concealing in his  and moody thought ought to be an interesting but harry 1
harry  s  he  got  quietly  into  his ten minutes the egg and the back in his he 1
thought like to check how scarred the rest  it as a chapter six

six  the  second  task  you  said already worked out that egg said hermione your 1
voice  said harry just need to of all and hermione were sitting at the very back 1
of  the charms with they were supposed to be practicing the opposite of the  the 1
banishing owing to the potential for nasty accidents when the professor flitwick 2
had  given  each  student  a stack of on  theory being that these hurt anyone if 1
they went off it working very aim was so poor that he kept accidentally sending 1
sending  eavier things flying across the room for forget the egg for a all harry 1
hissed  as  professor flitwick  resignedly past landing on top of a large trying 1
to tell you

you  this class was an ideal cover for a private as everyone was fun to pay them 1
any harry had been recounting his of the whispered installments for the last half 1
half  aid  moodys  searched  his  office as ron his eyes alight as he banished a 1
cushion with a sweep of his wand hat reckon here to keep an eye on snape as well 2
as   i dunno if what dumbledore asked him to but definitely said waving his wand 1
without  paying  much so that his cushion did belly flop off the said dumbledore 1
only  lets snape stay here him a second chance or said his eyes his next cushion 1
spinning  high  into  the  off the and dropping heavily onto maybe moody thinks 1
snape  put  your  name  in the goblet of said shaking her head thought snape was 1
trying  to kill harry and it turned out he was saving she banished a cushion and 1
it  flew  across  the room and supposed to be aiming harry looked at it was true 1
that  had   his life but the odd thing snape definitely loathed just father when 1
they  had been at school snape loved from  certainly never missed an opportunity 1
to  give  him or even be suspended from the care what moody hermione went not he 1
was  right  to  trust hagrid and professor even though loads of people so why he 1
be right about even if snape is a bit said ron why are all these dark wizard catchers 1
catchers earching his  has crouch been pretending to be said ignoring a bit that 2
he  cant  manage to come to the yule but he can get  of the night when he wants 1
just  like  crouch because of that said sending a cushion into the  just want to 1
think  snapes  up to said sending her cushion  zooming neatly into the just want 1
to  know  what snape did with his first if on his said harry and his to his very 1
great flew straight across the neatly on top of

of  obedient  to wish of hearing about anything odd at harry sent brown owl that 1
explaining all about crouch breaking into and then harry turned his attention in 2
earnest  to the most  facing how to survive underwater for an hour on the of ron 1
quite  liked  the  idea  of  using the summoning charm had and ron see why harry 1
summon  one  from the nearest muggle hermione squashed this plan by pointing out 1
in  the  unlikely  to  learn  how  to  operate an within the set limit of an he 1
isqualified  for breaking the international code of wizarding to that no muggles 1
would  spot  an  zooming across the countryside  the ideal solution would be for 1
you to transfigure into  hermione only done human transfiguration but i think we 2
start that until sixth and it can go badly wrong if ifancy walking around with a 2
periscope  sticking out of icould always attack someone in front of he might do 1
think  let  you choose what you wanted to be turned said ithink your best chance 1
is  some sort of so thinking that he would soon have had enough of the to buried 1
himself  once  more  among the dusty looking for any a  human to survive without 1
though  and  hermione  searched  their  and whole weekends harry asked professor 1
mcgonagall  for  anote  of permission to use the restricted and even asked madam 1
for  help found nothing whatsoever that would enable to spend an hour underwater 1
and live to tell the familiar flutterings of panic were starting to disturb harry 1
harry  o  concentrate  in  class the which harry had always taken feature of the 1
drew  his  eyes whenever he was near a classroom  gray mass of chilly whose dark 1
and icy depths were

clocks to go there was a week to go before  was still there were five days to go 2
was  bound to find  days to go let me find with two days harry started to go off 1
food  the  only good monday was the return of the brown owl he had sent unrolled 1
and  saw  the  shortest  letter  sirius had ever to  send date of next hogsmeade 1
weekend  by return harry turned the parchment over and looked at the hoping was 1
fter whispered who had read the note over harrys my quill and send this owl back 2
straight  harry scribbled the dates down on the back of tied it onto and watched 2
it  take  flight  what  had he advice on how to survive he had been so intent on 1
telling  sirius  all about snape mention the eggs he want to know about the next 1
hogsmeade weekend said said harry the momentary happiness that had flared inside 2
him

him the owl had on of magical whether hagrid was trying to make up for the or because 1
because  ow  only  two skrewts or because he was trying to prove harry didnt but 1
hagrid  had  been continuing her lessons on ever since returned to it turned out 1
that hagrid knew as  he did about though it was clear that he found their

before i saw yeh take on tha but can do yeh set yer mind not worried at goin ter 2
be got yer orked  harry but even as he did an insane urge to confess that he  to 2
survive  at  the  bottom of the lake for an hour came over he had to go into the 1
lake  to deal with the creatures else on the after all ter hagrid patting harrys 1
shoulder  so  that  harry actually felt himself sink a couple of inches into the 1
soft  know  i  harry n harry just bring himself to wipe the confident smile off 1
retending he was interested in the young he forced a forward to pat them with the 1
the y the evening before the second harry felt as though he was fully aware that 2
even  by  some he managed to find a  real job mastering it how could he have let 1
this  why  he   the  clue  why  had  he  ever let his mind wander in class if a 1
entioned how to breathe he sat with hermione and ron in the library as the sun set 1
set age after page of hidden from one another by the of front of each of harry s 2
heart  gave a huge leap every but more often than not it was merely two pints of 1
half  a  mandrake and a  reckon it can be said rons voice flatly from the other 1
losest  was  that  thing to dry up puddles and that drought but that was nowhere 1
near powerful enough to drain the must be hermione moving a candle closer to her 2
eyes  were   so  tired  she was poring over the tiny print of olde and  with her 1
nose  about  an inch from the never have set said just go down to the lake stick 1

for  tricky  learned  to  be an animagus like an animagus was a wizard who could 1
transform  into  an  you turned into a goldfish any time you said ayawned he was 1
takes  years  to  become  an  and   then  you have to register yourself and said 1
hermione now down the index of weird wizarding dilemmas and their mcgonagall got 2
to  register  yourself with the improper use of magic you and your so you abuse 1
was said harry know i got a chance of turning into a frog by tomorrow this is no 2

rookshanks crawled into harrys lap and curled purring the  emptied slowly around 2
people  kept  wishing him luck for the  confident voices like hagrid all of them 1
apparently that another stunning performance like the one he had managed he just 2
feeling  as  though  there were a golfball stuck in his he was alone in the room 1
with  he  had  searched all the and ron and hermione had not come he told you do 1

flashed sending colin and dennis creevey flying as he the out onto the chilly as 2

along the opposite rising in stands bursting point and reflected in the lake the 2
excited  babble  of  across the water as harry ran around the other side of were 1
sitting at another table at the and krum were beside the watching harry sprint toward 1
toward ere harry skidding to a halt in the mud and accidentally

accidentally  have  you  said a disapproving about to harry looked percy weasley 1
was  sitting at the table crouch to turn up  said ludo who was looking intensely 1
relieved  to  see  him  catch  his dumbledore smiled at but karkaroff and madame 1
maxime  look see it was obvious from the looks on their faces that they he turn 1
harry bent hands on his gasping for he had a stitch in his though he had a knife 2
between his but there was no to now moving among the spacing them along the bank 2
at  intervals of was on the very end of the next to who was wearing and  holding 1
his wand bagman whispered as he moved harry a few feet farther away  what going to 1
to arry massaging his  bagman gave shoulder a quick squeeze and returned to the he 1
he  and at his throat as he had done at the world and his  across the dark water 1
toward the all our champions are ready for the second which on

on have precisely an hour to recover what has been taken on

on  the  whistle  echoed  shrilly  in  the still the stands erupted with without 1
looking  to  see  what  the  other  champions  were harry  pulled the handful of 1
gillyweed out of his stuffed it into the  it was so cold he felt the skin on his 2
legs  searing  as  sodden  robes  weighed  him  down as he walked in now the his 1
rapidly  numbing feet were slipping over silt and slimy he gillyweed as hard and 1
fast  as  he  it felt unpleasantly slimy in the freezing water he and waited for 1
something to

to  he  could  hear  laughter in the crowd and knew he must  without showing any 1
sign  of magical the part of him that was goose half immersed in the icy a cruel 1
breeze  lifting  to  shiver he avoided looking at the the laughter was becoming 1
ere catcalls and jeering from the quite harry felt as though an invisible pillow 2
had  been  over   and  he  tried  to  draw  but it made his head his lungs were 1
suddenly felt a piercing pain on either side of his neck harry clapped his hands 2
around his throat and felt two in the cold he had without pausing to he did the only 1
only  lung  himself  forward into the the first gulp of icy lake water felt like 1
the  breath  of  took another great gulp of water and felt it pass his to his he 1
stretched  out  his  hands in front of him and at ghostly under the and they had 1
become  he twisted around  feet had become elongated and the toes were webbed it 1
looked as though he had sprouted the water feel icy anymore either the he felt pleasantly 1
pleasantly  arry  struck  out  once  marveling  at how far and fast his like him 1
through  the  and noticing how clearly he could and how need to he had soon swum 1
so  far  into  the lake that he flipped over and dived into its  silence pressed 1
upon  his ears as he soared over a foggy  only see ten feet around so that as he 1
sped  throuugh  the   suddenly  out of the incoming forests of tangled black mud 1
littered  with  glimmering  he  swam  deeper  and  out the  the his eyes staring 1
through  the  eerily  water  around  him   where  the  water  became  small fish 1
flickered  past  him like silver once or twice he he  larger moving ahead of but 1
when he got he discovered it to  blackened or a dense clump of there was no sign 2
of  ron  the giant light green weed stretched ahead of him as far as he could of 1
very  overgrown  harry  was staring unblinkingly ahead of trying through the and 1
without  something grabbed hold of his harry twisted his body around and saw a a 1
horned water poking out of the its long fingers clutched tightly around its pointed 1
pointed tuck his webbed hand quickly inside his robes and fumbled for

for  grasped  two  more  grindylows  had  risen  out  of the had seized and were 1
attempting  to  drag him  harry except that no sound came a large bubble issued 1
nd  his instead of sending sparks at the pelted them with to be a jet of boiling 1
for  where  it  struck angry red on harry pulled his ankle out of the grindylows 1
grip  and  as  as occasionally sending more jets of hot water over his shoulder 1
felt  one  of  the grindylows snatch at his foot and he he connect with a horned 1
and looking saw the dazed grindylow while its fellows shook their fists at harry 2
and sank back harry slowed down a slipped his wand back inside his  listening he 2
turned full circle in the the silence than he knew he must be even deeper in the 2
lake  but nothing ippling are you getting harry thought he was having a heart he 1
whipped  around  and saw  floating hazily in front of gazing at him through her 1
arry tried to shout once nothing came out of his mouth a moaning myrtle actually 1
actually  ant  to try over she come with i like them they always chase me when i 1
get  too  harry  gave her the to show his thanks and set off once careful higher 1
over  the  weed to avoid any more grindylows that might he swam on for what felt 1
like at least twenty he was black mud which swirled murkily as he disturbed the at 1
at  natch of haunting hour long have to and to recover what we harry swam faster 1
and  soon saw a large rock emerge out of the paintings of merpeople on they were 1
carrying spears and  harry swam on past the following the your half so tarry not 1
not  lest  what you seek stays here to acluster of crude stone dwellings stained 1
with algae loomed here and there at the dark harry saw faces that bore no to the 2
painting  of  the  mermaid  in the the merpeople had grayish skin and dark green 1
their  as were their broken and they wore thick ropes of pebbles around harry as 1
he  swam  one  or  two of them emerged from their  silver fish tails beating the 1
spears clutched in their harry sped staring and soon the dwellings became more there 1
there  ardens  of  weed  around  some  of  and he even saw a pet grindylow a one 1
merpeople  were  emerging  on  all  sides  watching  him at his webbed hands and 1
talking  behind  their  hands  to one harry a  and a very strange sight met his 1
whole crowd of merpeople was floating in front of the that

that  of  a  village  a choir of merpeople was singing in the calling  champions 1
toward  and  behind  them  rose a crude sort of a  from a four people were bound 1
tightly  to  the tail of ron was tied between hermione and cho there was also a 1
than  whose  clouds  of  silvery  hair made harry feel sure she all four of them 1
appeared  to  be  in  a  very deep their heads  and fine streams of bubbles kept 1
issuing from their  harry sped toward the half expecting the merpeople to lower 1
lower  t  but  they  did  the  ropes  of  weed tying the hostages and very for a 1
fleeting  second  he  thought  of the knife sirius christmas in his trunk in the 1
castle  a quarter of a mile no  he looked many of the merpeople surrounding them 1
were  carrying  swiftly toward a merman with a long green beard and a choker of 1
ried to mime a request to borrow the the merman laughed and  do not he said in a 2
croaky harry said fiercely only bubbles issued from his and he to the spear away 2
from the but the merman yanked it still

still  harry  swirled  staring something  there were rocks littering the lake he 1
dived  and  snatched up a and returned to the he began to hack at the ropes and 1
ard they broke ron a few inches above the lake drifting a little in the ebb of the 1
the  arry  looked  there  was no sign of any of the other what  playing why they 1
hurry  he  turned back to raised the jagged began to hack at her bindings too at 1
several pairs of strong gray hands seized half a dozen  away from shaking their and 1
and  take your own one of them said to the others  said harry furiously only two 1
large  bubbles  came   your  task  is  to retrieve your own leave the others my 1
gesturing  toward an enormous silver bubble emerging from his iwant them to die 1
ead  was  on  hermiones  the small girl was ghostly green and harry struggled to 1
fight  off  the but they laughed harder harry looked wildly where were the other 1
would  he  have  time ron to the surface and come back down for hermione them he 1
looked down at his watch to see how much time was

was but then the merpeople around him pointed excitedly over his cedric swimming 2
toward  there was an enormous bubble around his features look oddly wide and  he 1
looking and coming  feeling enormously harry watched cedric pull a knife out of 1
of  e  pulled  her  upward and out of harry looked where were fleur and time was 1
getting  and  according to the the hostages would be lost after an the merpeople 1
started  screeching  those holding harry loosened their  behind harry turned and 1
saw  something monstrous cutting ahuman body in swimming trunks with the head of 1
a it

it transfigured himselfbut  the man swam straight to hermione and began snapping 2
and  at   trouble  was that new teeth were positioned very awkwardly  than a and 1
harry  was  quite sure that if krum he was to hermione in darting harry hit krum 1
hard  on the shoulder up krum seized it and began to cut hermione within he had 1
ermione  around  the and without a backward began to her he now harry thought if 1
he could be sure that fleur was but no there was nothing to be done  he snatched 2
up  the  which  krum  had but the mermen now in ron and the little shaking their 1
heads  at  harry  pulled out  out of the only bubbles flew out of his but he had 1
the distinct the  understood because they suddenly stopped their yellowish eyes 1
eyes  nd  they looked there might be a lot more of them than  but harry could by 1
the  looks  on  their  that  they  knew  quid  got until harry a great stream of 1
bubbles  burst  from he  up three fingers to make sure they got the put down put 1
down  a  second they harry darted forward and began to hack at the ropes the and 1
at last she was he seized the little girl around rons and kicked off from the it 2
was  very  slow he could no longer use his webbed hands  worked his flippers but 1
ron and sister were like sacks him back he fixed his eyes though he knew he must 2
still   water  above  him  was  so  merpeople were rising with he could see them 1
swirling  around  him  struggle through the would they pull him back down to was 1
did  they perhaps eat legs were seizing up with the to his shoulders were aching 1
horribly with the effort of ron he was drawing breath with extreme he could feel 2
pain  on  again  was becoming very aware of how wet the water was was definitely 1
thinning  he  could  see  daylight  above  he  kicked hard with his flippers and 1
discovered  that  they  was flooding through his mouth into his lungs was to and 1
air  were  only ten feet above him had to get there had to harry kicked his legs 1
so  hard  and  fast it felt as though his very brain felt he he needed he had to 1
keep  he could not stop  and then he felt his head break the surface of the air 1
is  wet  face  he  gulped  it  feeling as though he had never pulled ron and the 1
little girl up with all around were emerging out of the water with but they were 2
smiling  at  the crowd in the stands was making a great deal of and seemed to be 1
on  their  harry had the impression they ron might be but they were both of them 1
had opened their the and but ron merely expelled a great spout of blinked in  to 2
and then he spotted did you bring her

her turn i leave harry you said take that song thing did dumbledore have let any 2
of  us  song  said was only to make sure you got back inside the time said waste 1
time down there acting the harry felt both stupid and it was all very well for been 1
been elt how eerie it was down in the surrounded by merpeople more than capable of 1
of  arry  said  me with i think she can swim very they pulled sister through the 1
back toward the bank the twenty merpeople accompanying them like a guard of singing 1
singing  creechy  harry  could  see  madam  pomfrey fussing over and all of were 1
wrapped  in  thick dumbledore and ludo bagman stood beaming at harry and ron but 1
who looked very white and somehow much younger than out to meet meanwhile madame 2
maxime  was trying to restrain quite fighting tooth and nail to return to the is 1
she is she harry tried to tell but he was so exhausted he could hardly

hardly  percy  seized  ron  and was dragging him back to the bank dumbledore and 1
bagman  were  pulling  harry fleur had broken free of and was hugging her was ze 1
zey  attacked me i i  said madam she seized harry and pulled him over to and the 1
wrapped  him  so  tightly  in a blanket that he felt as  and forced a measure of 1
very hot potion down his steam gushed well hermione did you found out how all by 1
by  aid  he  would have told her about but he had just  watching he was the only 1
judge  who had not left the of pleasure and relief that and sister had got back 1
aid raising his voice slightly so that karkaroff could hear  haff a water beetle 2
in  your  said  harry  had  the   that  krum was drawing her attention back onto 1
perhaps  to  rescued her from the but hermione brushed away the well outside the 1
time  did it take you ages to find found you feeling of stupidity was now he was 1
out  of  the it seemed  clear that dumbledores safety precautions have permitted 1
the of a because their champion turned why he just grabbed ron and he  have been 2
first  cedric  and  krum wasted time worrying about taken the mersong dumbledore 1

what  had  happened  down  in  the  which share limelight for harry noticed that 1
version  of events every at he gave what seemed to be the it tallied with anyway 1
had put all the hostages into a bewitched sleep in first assuring them that they 2
would  be  quite  and  would when above the one week ron was telling a thrilling 1
tale  of  struggled against fifty heavily armed merpeople who had to  submission 1

his  cauldron and front of the dungeon to the empty snape sat down at his unload 1
his  determined  not to look at harry resumed the of imagining each one to have 1
this press attention seems to have inflated your said snape once the rest of the 2
class had settled down harry he knew snape was trying to provoke he had done this 1
this oubt he was hoping for an excuse to take a round fifty he might be laboring 2
under  the  delusion that the entire wizarding snape went so quietly that no one 1
else  could  hear him  scarab even though he had already reduced them to a very 1
ow  many  times  your  picture appears in the to you are nothing  little boy who 1
considers  rules  to  be  beneath  harry  tipped  the  powdered beetles into his 1
cauldron  and  up  hands were shaking slightly out of but he kept his what snape 1
was saying to

in ear had needed it for the polyjuice potion while snape he had never been able 2
to  prove  of had stolen the know what talking harry lied were out of bed on the 1
night  my  office  was  broken  moody  might have joined your fan but i will not 1
tolerate  your one more nighttime stroll into my and you will said harry turning 1
back to his ginger bear that in mind if the urge to go in eyes he plunged a hand 2
into the inside of his black  harry thought snape was about to pull out his wand 2
and  he  snape  had drawn out a small crystal bottle of a clear at you know what 1
this  snape his eyes glittering dangerously  said with complete honesty this  is 1
veritaserum truth potion so powerful that three drops innermost secrets for this 2
entire  class to said snape the is controlled by very strict ministry but unless 1
you  your  find that my hand shook the crystal bottle slightly and then find out 1
whether been in my office or harry said he turned back to his ginger roots once picked 1
picked  tarted slicing them he like the sound of that truth potion past snape to 1
slip  him he repressed a shudder at of out of his mouth if snape did quite apart 1
from  landing a hermione and dobby for a start were all the other things that he 1
was  in  contact  with and insides squirmed at the he he tipped his ginger roots 1
into the cauldron and wondered leaf out of moody s book and start drinking only a 1
a  here  was  a  knock  on  the dungeon said snape in his usual the class looked 1
around  as  the  door professor karkaroff came him as he walked up toward he was 1
twisting  his  finger  around ooking need to said karkaroff abruptly when he had 1
reached  he seemed  determined that nobody should hear what he was saying he was 1
as though he were a rather poor harry kept his eyes listening  talk to you after 2
my snape but karkaroff interrupted want to talk while you slip been avoiding the 2
snape  under the pretext of holding up a measuring cup to see if harry sneaked a 2
sidelong  glance  at  the  pair  of karkaroff and snape looked karkaroff hovered 1
behind  desk  for the rest of the double he  preventing snape from slipping away 1
at the end of to

to  harry deliberately knocked over his bottle of armadillo bile  which gave him 1
an excuse to duck down behind his cauldron and the class moved noisily toward the 1
the  o  he  heard  snape  hiss  at  said  and peering around the edge of his saw 1
karkaroff  pull  up the sleeve of his robe and show snape something on his  said 1
still  making  every  effort not to move his you never been this never since  it 1
snarled his black eyes sweeping the you must have noticed karkaroff began in an agitated 1
agitated can talk spat what are you up my armadillo said harry straightening up and 1
and  howing  snape the sodden rag he was karkaroff turned on his heel and strode 1
out  of  the  not  wanting  to  remain  alone with an exceptionally angry harry 1
ngredients back into his bag and left at top speed to he

he  they  left  the  castle at noon the next day to find a weak  the weather was 1
milder  than  it  had  been all and by the all three of them had taken off their 1
cloaks and thrown them the food sirius had told them to bring was in they had a 1
a  loaf  of  and a flask of pumpkin juice from the lunch they went into gladrags 1
wizardwear to buy a present for the most lurid socks they could including a pair 2
patterned  with  and  another that screamed loudly when they became too at half 1
heir  way  up the high past dervish and and out the harry had never been in this 1
direction  the  winding  lane  was out wild countryside around the cottages were 1
fewer  and their gardens  were walking toward the foot of the mountain in whose 1
urned  a  corner and saw a stile at the end of the waiting on topmost was a very 1
shaggy  black  which was carrying some in mouth and looking very said harry when 1
they  had  reached   the black dog sniffed bag wagged its tail then turned  away 1
from  them across the scrubby patch of ground that and hermione climbed over the 1
stile  and  sirius  led them to the very foot of the where the ground was and it 1
was  easy  for with his four but and hermione were soon  of they followed sirius 1
up  onto  the  mountain  for  nearly  an  climbed  a and stony following wagging 1
sweating  in  the  the shoulder straps of bag cutting into his at sirius slipped 1
out  of  and  when  they reached the place they saw a narrow fissure in the they 1
squeezed  into  it and in  dimly lit tethered at the end of one end of his rope 1
uckbeak  the half gray half giant fierce orange eye at the sight of all three of 1
them  bowed  low  to  and  after  for  a buckbeak bent his scaly front knees and 1
allowed to stroke his feathery was looking at the black which had just is

longer than it had been when he had in untidy and matted once he looked very  he 2
said hoarsely after removing the old daily prophets his  throwing them down onto 2
the  cave  harry  pulled  open  his  bag and handed over the bundle of and  said 1
opening  grabbing a sitting down on the cave and  tearing off a large chunk with 1
his been living off rats steal  food from draw attention to he grinned up at but 2
harry returned the grin only you doing he my duty as said gnawing on the chicken 2
bone  in  a very worry about pretending to be a lovable  he was still but seeing 1
the  anxiety in harrys said to on the your last just say things are getting been 1
stealing the  paper every time someone throws one and by the looks of getting he 2
nodded  at  the  yellowing  daily prophets on the cave and unfolded continued to 1
stare  at   if  they catch what if three and dumbledore are the only ones around 1
here  who  and continuing to devour the chicken  ron nudged harry and passed him 1
the daily there were  headline mystery illness ofbartemius the ministry witch of 2

before  we  got in and then i put my hand in my and all that was in there stared 1
at  you  saying  whoever conjured the mark stole my aid  steal that hermione elf 1
the  only  one  in that said his brow furrowed as he else was sitting behind  of 1

all  around  the  and  buckbeak  tossed his head bet it was lucius aid aid there 1
there was ludo hermione reminded

mark  told  she said to harry and but he stay in the did said moment we told him 1
about  the  he went off to the hermione shot know where he disapparated off said 1
ron  you  saying you reckon ludo bagman conjured the dark  more likely he did it 1
than  said  hermione  said  looking  meaningfully at you obsessed with house but 1
sirius held up a hand to silence  the dark mark had been and the elf had been discovered 1
discovered  what  did crouch to look in the said there anyone else sirius pacing 1
up  and want to pin it on anyone but his own and then he sacked said hermione in 1
a  heated  sacked  just because she stayed in tent and let herself get trampled 1
ill  you give it a rest with the said  sirius shook his head and got the measure 1
of crouch than you want to know what a mans take a good look at how

how  he  ran a hand over his unshaven evidently thinking these absences of barty 1
goes  to  the trouble of making sure saves him a seat at the quidditch world but 1
bother to turn up very hard to reinstate the triwizard and then stops coming to 1
to  if ever taken a day off work because of illness before eat know said face he 1
suddenly looked as menacing as he had the night

night met the night when harry still believed sirius to be a iknow crouch all he 2
said was the one who gave the order  be sent to azkaban a said ron and hermione 1
hermione  said  said taking another great bite of used to be head of  department 1
of  magical law you and hermione shook their was tipped for the next minister of 1
said  a great barty  powerfully magical oh never a voldemort he reading the look 1
on harrys barty crouch was always very against but then a lot of people who were 2
against the dark you oo what my dad said at the world said with a trace of in his 1
his  hy  agrin flashed across thin try he walked once up the back and then that 1
powerful  you  know who his supporters you know working for him and who you know 1
he can control people so do without being able to stop scared for and your and your 1
your  very  news  comes  of more more more the  ministry of in they know what to 1
trying  to  keep   hidden  from the but muggles are dying terror how it used to 1
imes like that bring out the best in some people and the principles been good in 2
the  beginning  he  rose  quickly  through  and  he  started ordering very harsh 1
measures against voldemorts  were given new powers to kill rather than for and i 2
the  one  who  was  handed  straight  to  the  dementors without crouch with and 1
authorized  the  use of the unforgivable curses against i became as ruthless and 1
cruel as many on the dark he had of people thought he was going about things the 2
right  and  a  wizards clamoring for him to take over as minister of looked like 1
only a matter of time until crouch got the unfortunate sirius smiled own son was 2
caught  with  a  group death eaters managed to talk their way out of apparently 1
ind  voldemort and return him to  son was gasped  said throwing his chicken bone 1
to  flinging  himself  back  down   ground  beside the loaf of and tearing it in 1
little  for  should  have spent a bit more time at home with his ought  left the 1
office early once in a gotten to know his own he began to wolf down large pieces 2
of his son a death said said still stuffing down was in azkaban myself when he was 1
was  rought this is mostly stuff found out since i got the the company of people 1
bet  my  life  were death eaters he  place at the wrong just like the crouch try 1
and get his son hermione  sirius let out a laugh that was much more like a

a  let  his  son  i  thought  you had the measure of anything that threatened to 1
tarnish  his reputation had to he had his life minister of you saw him dismiss a 1
devoted  because  she him dark mark again that tell you what fatherly affection 1
far enough to give his son a and by all it much crouch to show how much he hated 2
the  then  he  sent  him to gave his own son to the asked harry said and he look 1
remotely amused saw the dementors  bringing him watched them through the bars in 2
my  cell he  they took him into a cell near he was screaming  went quiet after a 1
few they all went quiet in the  in their  for a the deadened look in eyes became 2
more  pronounced  than   though  shutters  had closed behind still in harry said 1
sirius not in there he died about a year after they im

him  the  only said sirius go mad in and plenty stop eating in the they lose the 1
will  to  you  could always tell when a was  dementors could sense they got that 1
boy looked pretty sickly being an important ministry he and his wife were a was 1
was  ast time i saw barty half carrying his wife past my she shortly wasted away 1
just  like  the crouch never came for his the dementors buried him outside the i 1
watched  them  do  sirius threw aside the bread he had just lifted to his mouth 1
umpkin juice and drained old crouch lost it just when he thought he had it he his 1
his  outh  with the back of his a poised to become minister his son his wife the 1
family name so heard since i abig drop in once the boy had people started a bit 1
bit  oward the son and started asking how a nice young lad from a the conclusion 1
was  that his father never cared much for so top and crouch was shunted sideways 1
into the department of

of  there  was  a long harry was thinking of the way eyes had looked down at his 1
disobedient back in the wood at the must have been why crouch had overreacted to 2
winky being it had brought back memories of his and the old and his

his  says crouch is obsessed with catching dark harry told heard become a bit of 1
a mania with said you ask he still thinks he can bring back the old popularity by 1
by e sneaked up here to search s aid ron looking at

at and that make sense at said  it said ron but sirius shook his if crouch wants 2
to  investigate  why he been coming to judge it would be an ideal excuse to make 1
regular visits to

to  you  think  snape  could  be  up  to asked but hermione broke icare what you 1
dumbledore  trusts  snape give it a said ron know dumbledores brilliant and  but 1
that  mean a really clever dark wizard fool him did snape save life in the first 1
why  he  just let him  dunno he thought dumbledore would kick him harry said and 1
ron and hermione stopped bickering to

to think both got a said looking thoughtfully at ron and since i found out snape 2
was  teaching  wondered why dumbledore always been fascinated by the dark he was 1
famous for it  he sirius and harry and ron grinned at each knew more curses when 2
he arrived at school than half the kids in he  gang of slytherins who nearly all 2
turned  out  to  be  death  sirius held up his fingers and began ticking off and 1
wilkes  were  both  killed  by  aurors  the year before the lestranges a married 1
couple  in  avery  what  heard  he  wormed his way out of trouble by saying been 1
acting under but as far as i snape was never even accused of being  means plenty 2
of them were never and snape s certainly and enough to keep himself out of knows 2
karkaroff  pretty  but  he  wants to keep that said you seen face when karkaroff 1
turned up in potions said harry wanted to talk to he says been avoiding karkaroff 1
karkaroff  ooked  really  he  showed  snape something on his but i see he showed 1
snape  something on his said looking frankly he fingers distractedly through his 1
filthy then shrugged no but if karkaroff s genuinely and going to snape for answers 1
answers  irius  stared  at  the  cave then made a grimace of still the fact that 1
dumbledore  trusts  and  i  know dumbledore a of other people but i just see him 1
letting  snape  teach worked for are moody and crouch so keen to get into snapes 1
office said said sirius put it past to have searched every single office when he 2
got  to  he takes his defense against the not sure he trusts anyone at and after 1
the  things not say this for he never killed if he could help always brought in 1
here  he  was  but he never descended to the level of the  a different matter he 1
really if he why did he make to  himself up to and if he up what was he doing at 2
the   cup  that  was so important he turn up in the top he been should have been 1
judging  the  sirius lapsed into still staring at the cave buckbeak was on rocky 1
looking for bones he might have sirius looked up say your brother s personal any 2
chance  you  could  ask  him   seen crouch can said ron not make it sound like i 1
reckon  crouch  anything  percy loves you might try and find out whether got any 1
leads on while at said gesturing to the second copy of the daily

daily  told me they said  quoted in the article in said nodding at the on  about 1
how  bad  memory  maybe changed since i knew but the i knew forgetful at all the 1
she was a bit but she had an memory for it used to get her into a lot of she never 1
never outh i can see her being a bit of a liability at the bagman bother to look 2
for her for so  sirius heaved an enormous sigh and rubbed his shadowed the harry 2
checked his then remembered it been working since it  hour in the half past said 1
said etter get back to sirius getting to his he looked particularly hard at want 2
you  lot  sneaking  out of school to send notes to me i still want to hear about 1
anything but not  hogwarts without it would be an ideal opportunity for someone 1
someone ried to attack me so except a dragon and a couple of but sirius scowled at 1
at  breathe  freely again when this and not until  and if talking about me among 1
call me he handed harry the empty napkin and flask and went to pat walk the edge 2
of  the  village with said if i can scrounge he transformed into the great black 1
dog before they left the the mountainside with across the strewn and back to the 2
he  allowed  each  of them to pat him on the before turning outskirts of the and 1
hermione  made their way back into oward if percy knows all that stuff about ron 1
said  as  they  up  the maybe he probably just make him admire crouch even percy 1
loves  just  say  crouch was refusing to break them for would never throw any of 1
his family to the said hermione said he thought we were standing in the way of his 1
his  eally you they walked up the stone steps into the entrance where of  wafted 1
toward them from the great old said breathing must really like imagine having to 2
live  off  hapter   the  madness of mr crouch and hermione went up to the owlery 1
after  breakfast  on sunday  as sirius had whether he had seen crouch they used 1
ecause it had been so long since had a when they had of sight through the owlery 2
they proceeded down to the kitchen

kitchen the gave them a very cheery bowing and curtsying and bustling making tea 2
dobby was ecstatic about his potter is too good to he wiping large tears out of

of  saved  my life with that you really said chance of more of those is said who 1
was  looking  around  at  beaming  and bowing just had said hermione but a great 1
silver platter of already zooming toward supported by four should get some stuff 2
to  send  up  to harry said pig something to you give us a bit of extra could he 1
said  to  the surrounding and they bowed delightedly ome said who was looking is 1
over  there  by  the said dobby his ears drooping  said hermione as she spotted 1
harry  looked  over  at  the fireplace winky was sitting on the  she had allowed 1
herself  to  become so filthy that she was  brick behind her clothes were ragged 1

his  he  could  hear an insect humming the his eyelids began to he was riding on 1
the  back  of  an  eagle soaring through the blue  house set high on a lower and 1

who was wearing an expression of great as had just been denied a real when harry 2
reached  the  bottom of her he did not set off he had no intention whatsoever of 1
going sirius had told  hurt him and harry was going to follow his he was going to 1
to  e  marched  down the thinking about what he had seen in the been as vivid as 1
the  one  that had awoken him on privet trying to make sure he could remember he 1
had heard wormtail of making a but the owl had brought good the had somebody was 2
dead  wormtail  was not going to be fed to  was going to be fed to it  harry had 1
walked  right  past  the  stone gargoyle guarding the without he looked realized 1
what  he  had  and  retraced his stopping in front of then he remembered that he 1
know the  he tried  the gargoyle did not said staring at er fizzing best blowing 2
bertie  every flavor beans he like does oh  just he said really need to see its 1
he gargoyle remained harry kicked achieving nothing but an excruciating pain in 1
in e yelled standing on one cockroach  the gargoyle sprang to life and jumped harry 1
harry  e was only he hurried through the gap in the walls and stepped onto which 1
moved  slowly  upward as the doors closed behind him a door with a brass door he 1
could hear voices from inside the he stepped off the

cracked than sure given his personal history his and gone wandering off omewhere 1
omewhere  wandered  extremely  if that is the said dumbledore else fudge sounded 1
reserve judgment until after seen the place where he was but you say it was just 1
just  you  know  what  that woman consider her to be a very able headmistress 1
said  said  fudge you think you might be prejudiced in her favor because of 1
they  all  turn out harmless you can call with that monster fixation got no more 1

fudge not said just that potter wants a word with just outside the  chapter thirty 1
thirty  he  pensieve the door of the office said harry walked he had been inside 1
office  once it was a very  circular lined with pictures of previous headmasters 1
and of all of whom were fast their chests rising and falling cornelius fudge was 2
standing beside wearing his usual cloak and holding his bowler said fudge moving 2
are  arry were just talking about the night when crouch turned up on was you who 1

been he see madame maxime and have a job

short  walk on the if excuse us if you just go back to your class wanted to talk 1
to  harry  said  looking at who gave him  a searching here for he examination of 1
the grounds will not take they trooped out in silence past him and closed the after 1
after  lunks  of  wooden  leg growing fainter in the corridor he e professor was 1
standing  on  his  golden  perch  beside  the  the size of a with magnificent he 1
swished  his  long  tail  and   blinked benignly at harry sat down in a chair in 1
front  of  for  several  he  sat  watched the old headmasters and headmistresses 1
snoozing  in their  had just and running his fingers over his it had stopped  he 1
felt  much now that he was in knowing he would  shortly be telling him about the 1
harry looked up at the the and ragged sorting hat was standing on a a glass case 1
case  word  with  large  rubies  set into the which harry recognized  out of the 1
sorting  hat  in  his  second  the  sword  had  once founder of he was gazing at 1
remembering how it had come had thought all hope was when he noticed a patch of and 1
and  n  the  glass  he  looked  around  for  the source of the light and shining 1
brightly  from  within  a black cabinet behind whose door  harry glanced at then 1
got walked across the and pulled open the cabinet

cabinet a shallow stone basin lay with odd carvings around the harry did not the 2
silvery  light  was  coming  from  the which were nothing harry had ever seen he 1
could not tell whether the or  was a whitish and it was moving the surface of it 2
like   water  beneath  and like separated and swirled it looked like made liquid 1
like  wind  made  solid make up his  he wanted to touch to find out what it felt 1
but nearly magical world told him that sticking his hand into a bowl very stupid 2
thing  to  he  therefore  pulled his wand out look around the looked back at the 1
contents  of  the  and  the surface of the silvery stuff inside the basin began 1
arry  bent his head right inside the the silvery substance had it looked like he 1
looked  down  into  it  expecting  to see the basin saw instead an enormous room 1
below the surface of the  into which he seemed to be looking through a circular in 1
in  he  room  was  dimly  he  thought  it might even be for no merely torches in 1
brackets such as the ones that the of face so that his nose was a mere inch away 2
from  the glassy rows of witches and wizards were seated around every wall in an 1
empty  chair  stood  in  the  very  center of the there chair that gave harry an 1
ominous  chains encircled the arms were usually tied to where was this it surely 1
he  had  never  seen  a  room  like that the crowd in the mysterious room at the 1
bottom  of the basin and harry knew there were not nearly that many teachers at 1
o be waiting for even though he could only see the tops their faces seemed to be 2
pointing  in  one and none of them the basin being and the room he was observing 1
harry  could  what was going on in the corners of he leaned even tilting the tip 1
of  his nose touched the strange substance into he office gave an almighty lurch 1
was  thrown forward and pitched into the substance inside the basin but his head 1
did  not  hit  the  stone he was falling through it was like being sucked into a 1
dark  whirlpool  and  harry found himself sitting on a bench at the end of bench 1
raised  high  above  the  he looked up at the high stone circular window through 1
which  he  had  just been but there solid breathing hard and harry looked around 1
not  one of the and in room there were at least two hundred of was looking at to 1
have  noticed  that  a  boy had just dropped from the harry turned to the wizard 1
next  to him on the bench a reverberated around the silent  he was sitting right 1
next  to  albus harry said in a kind of strangled sorry mean to was just looking 1
at  that basin in your cabinet are  but dumbledore move or he ignored harry like 1
every  other  on the he was staring into the far corner of the was harry at then 1
around at the silently watchful then back at and then it dawned on

on  once  harry had found himself somewhere that nobody could see  he had fallen 1
through a page in an enchanted right into  and unless he was very much something 2
of  the sort had harry raised his right and then waved it energetically in from 1
umbledore did not look around at or indeed move at and in settled the dumbledore 2
ignore him like he was inside a and this was not the yet it be that long the dumbledore 1
dumbledore  itting next to him now was just like the but what was this what were 1
all these wizards waiting harry looked around more the as he had suspected when it 1
it  as  almost  certainly  underground  of  a  dungeon than a he was a bleak and 1
forbidding air about the there were no on decorations at just these serried rows 2
of  rising  in  levels  all the positioned so that they had a clear view of that 1
chair  with  before  harry could reach any conclusions about the place in he the 1
door  in  the  corner  of  the  dungeon  opened and three people flanked by two 1
insides  went  the dementors hooded creatures whose faces were concealed gliding 1
slowly  toward  the  chair in the center of the arms with their dead and the man 1
between them looked though he was about to and harry blame him knew the dementors 1
dementors  ouch  him  inside  a  but he remembered their power only too recoiled 1
slightly as the dementors placed the man in the and  the door swung shut behind 1
behind arry looked down at the man now sitting in the chair and unlike karkaroff 2
looked  much  his  hair  and goatee were he not dressed in sleek but in thin and 1
ragged  he  was  even  the  chains on the arms of the chair glowed suddenly and 1
binding  him   said a curt voice to harry looked around and saw crouch  standing 1
up  in  the  middle  of  the  bench beside hair was  he looked fit and have been 1
brought  from azkaban to to ministry of you have given us to understand that you 1
have  for  karkaroff straightened himself as best he tightly bound to the he and 1
although  his  voice  was very harry could still hear  familiar unctuous note in 1
wish to be of use to the i i ministry is trying to round up the last of the dark 2
i  any  way  i  there  was  a  murmur  around  the some of the wizards and were 1
karkaroff  with others with pronounced then harry quite from dumbledores other a 1
growling  voice  harry  leaned forward so that he could see past moody was there 1
that  there  was  a very noticeable difference in his he  magical but two normal 1
both  were  looking down upon and narrowed in intense  is going to let him moody 1
breathed quietly to done a deal  with took me six months to track him and crouch 2

news  had  come  as  names  was  said crouch yes was said karkaroff  is said was 1

killed in the abit of me with whispered moody to harry looked around at him once 2
and  saw him indicating the large chunk out of more than rosier said a real note 1
of  panic in his voice  harry could see that he was starting to worry that none 1
he  eyes  darted  toward the door in the behind which the undoubtedly still aid 1
aid  was  travers  helped murder the mulciber specialized in the imperius forced 1
countless people to do was a and passed useful information from inside the

wearing a look of deep

the  voice  harry  looked  the  dungeon  was  dissolving  as  though  it made of 1
everything was he could see only his own body was

left side of the atmosphere seemed quite  the witches and wizards all around the 2
walls  were  talking  though they were at some sort of sporting harry noticed a 1
enches  she  had  short  blonde  was wearing magenta and was the  end of an it a 1
younger rita harry looked dumbledore was sitting beside him wearing different crouch 1
crouch  and  somehow harry it was a different a different day ifferent  the door 1
in  the  corner  and ludo bagman walked into the  this was a ludo bagman gone to 1
but  a  ludo  bagman who the height of his his nose broken he was tall and lean 1

witches  in  the surrounding seats not appear to share their he was staring down 1
at ludo with utmost severity and never spoke a truer someone muttered dryly to dumbledore 1
dumbledore he looked around and saw moody sitting there i know have said some of 2
those  bludgers had permanently affected his you were caught passing information 1
to  lord  said  isuggest  a  term of imprisonment in azkaban lasting no less but 1
there was an angry outcry from the surrounding several

friend of my never crossed mind he was in with i thought i was collecting information 1

their those in favor of  harry looked toward the side of the not one person many 2
of  the  witches  and  wizards around the walls began to tood arked just like to 1
congratulate  bagman  on his splendid performance quidditch match against turkey 1
last  the witch said crouch looked the dungeon was ringing with applause bagman 1
eet  and  crouch  spat at sitting down as bagman walked out of the get him a job 1
the day ludo bagman joins us will be a  indeed for the and the dungeon dissolved 2
when it had harry looked he and  dumbledore were still sitting beside but the atmosphere 1
atmosphere  there was total broken only by the dry sobs of a in the seat next to 1
she  was  clutching a handkerchief to her harry looked up at crouch and saw that 1
he  looked  gaunter  a   nerve was twitching in his them he and his voice echoed 1
through  the silent the door in the corner opened yet six dementors entered four 1
harry  saw  the  people  in  the  crowd  turn to look up at whispered to one the 1
dementors  placed each of the four people in the four stood on the dungeon there 1
was a thickset man who stared  and more whose eyes were darting around the a woman 1
woman hining dark hair and heavily hooded who was sitting in the  a and a boy in 2
his  late who looked nothing short of he was hair all over his his freckled skin 1
the wispy little witch  crouch began to rock backward and forward in her whimpering 1

with  the  eyes looked up at crouch and lord will rise throw us into we will he 1

raining  power  starting to affect the crowd was some of  woman swept out of the 1
and  the boy continued to your he screamed up at your are no son of bellowed his 1
eyes bulging have no the wispy witch beside him gave a great gasp and slumped in 2
her crouch appeared not to have  them crouch roared at the spit flying from his them 1
them  and may they rot iit is time to return to my said a quiet voice in harrys 1
arry he looked then he looked on his other there was an albus dumbledore sitting 2
on his watching son being away by the dementors there was an albus dumbledore on 2
his at said the dumbledore on his and he put his hand under  himself rising into 2
the the dungeon dissolved around for a  and then he felt as though he had done a 2
suddenly  landing   in  what  seemed  like the dazzling light of sunlit the was 1
shimmering  in  the  cabinet in front of and albus dumbledore  harry know i mean 1
cabinet  door  was  sort of open and quite said he lifted the carried it over to 1
his  placed  it  upon  the polished and sat down in the chair behind he pposite 1
harry  did  staring  at  the  stone the contents had returned white swirling and 1
rippling beneath his  is harry asked it is called a said sometimes and i am sure 2
you  know   the  that i simply have too many thoughts and memories into said who 1
truthfully say that he had ever felt anything of these said indicating the stone 2
use the one simply  siphons the excess thoughts from pours them into the and at 1
at t becomes easier to spot patterns and you when they are

are that your harry staring at the swirling white substance in the  said me show 1
show  umbledore  drew  his  wand out of the inside of his robes silvery near his 1
when  he  took  the  wand hair seemed to be then harry saw that it was in fact a 1
glistening  strand of the that filled the dumbledore added this fresh thought to 1
the and  saw his own face swimming around the surface of the his  on either side 2
of  the  pensieve  and  swirled rather as a of and harry saw his own face change 1
smoothly  into  who  his  spoke  to  the  his  voice echoing  coming karkaroff s 1
stronger and clearer than connection i could have made without dumbledore never 1
never  e  peered  over  the  top  of  his  spectacles  at  who was at  which was 1
continuing  to  swirl  around the was using the when arrived for our meeting and 1
put  it  away  rather  undoubtedly  i  door  it  would have attracted your arry 1
umbledore  shook  his  is  not a he we should exercise caution  with our indeed 1
rowning  he  prodded the thoughts within the basin with of afigure rose out of a 1
scowling  girl  of  about  who  to  her  feet  still  in  the she took no notice 1
whatsoever  of when she her voice echoed as had as though it were coming  of the 1
stone  put  a  hex  on  professor  and  i  was only teasing i only said seen him 1
kissing behind

behind said dumbledore looking up at the now silently revolving  did you have to 2
follow  him  in the first harry looking up at that that bertha said prodding the 1
thoughts  in  the basin bertha sank back into and they became silvery and opaque 1
once was bertha as i her at  the silvery light from the pensieve illuminated and 2
it  harry  suddenly how very old he was he of that dumbledore was on but somehow 1
he  never  really thought of dumbledore as an said dumbledore you got lost in my 1

i  who suggested safest place for him to  dumbledore got up and began walking up 1
and down behind his placed his wand tip to his removed another shining silver and 1
and  he  thoughts  inside began to swirl so fast that harry make it was merely a 1
blur  of   he said after a couple of  dumbledore stopped pacing and looked at he 1

at harry for a and then a  more than it is my belief that your scar hurts both when 1
when hen he is feeling a particularly strong surge of

anything to would i he got a has but then how could he have held harry said uttered 1

and placing his wand tip to his temple and thought to the seething mass within the 1
the  arry  said  at you think getting said looking at harry over the it was the 1
iercing look dumbledore had given him on other and always made though dumbledore 2
were  seeing  right through him in a way ican only give you my dumbledore sighed 1
and  he  looked  and  than  years of ascent to he marked with bertha jorkins has 1
vanished without a trace in the place where  be crouch too has within these very 2
and  there was a one which the i regret to do not consider of any for concerns a 1
his  name  was frank he lived in the village grew and he has not been seen since 1
last you i read the unlike most of my ministry  dumbledore looked very seriously 2
at  disappearances  seem  to  me to be the ministry disagrees you  while waiting 1
outside  my  harry silence fell between them dumbledore extracting thoughts now 1
nd harry felt as though he ought to but his curiosity in he said aid

said  could  i ask you that court thing i was in the said dumbledore attended it 1
many  but  some  trials  come back to me more clearly than others  know know the 1
trial  you found me the one with they talking about dumbledore gave harry a very 1
sharp  has  neville never told he brought up by his he harry shook his as he did 1
how  he could have failed to ask  almost four years of knowing they were talking 1
about  nevilles  said  was  an  auror  just  like professor he and his wife were 1
tortured for whereabouts after he lost his as you said harry said his voice full 2
of  a bitterness harry had never heard are they are both in hospital for magical 1
maladies and i  believe neville visits with his during the they do not

not harry sat he had never in four bothered to find

find  longbottoms  were very said attacks on them came after fall from just when 1
everyone thought they were those attacks a wave of fury such as i have never the 2
ministry  was  under  great who had done the evidence was their condition oo son 1
might  not  have been said harry dumbledore shook his  to i have no harry sat in 1
silence  once  watching the contents of the more questions he was burning to but 1
they concerned the guilt e never been accused of any dark activity said dumbledore 1
dumbledore  said  harry staring at the contents of the pensieve which were  more 1
slowly  now  that  dumbledore  had  stopped adding but the pensieve seemed to be 1
asking his question for  face was swimming on the surface dumbledore glanced down 1
down  p  at  more has professor he harry looked into light blue and the thing he 1
really  wanted  out  of  his  mouth  before  he could stop made you think really 1
stopped  supporting  dumbledore held harrys gaze for a few and then is a between 1
professor snape and  harry knew that the interview was dumbledore did not look a 1
a  finality  in  his  tone  that  told harry it was time to he  he said as harry 1
reached the do not speak about parents to anybody he has the right to let people 2
when he is  said turning to

to  harry  looked dumbledore was standing over the his face lit from its silvery 1
spots of looking older than he stared at harry for

for  luck  with  the  third  hapter   the  third task dumbledore reckons getting 1
stronger again as ron everything harry had seen in the nearly everything dumbledore 1
dumbledore  im he had now shared with ron and hermione of with to whom harry had 1
sent  an  owl the moment he had left and hermione sat up late in the common room 1
once again that talking it until he understood what dumbledore had meant about a 2
head so thoughts that it would have been a relief to siphon them ron stared into 2
the  common  room harry thought he saw ron shiver the evening was  he trusts ron 1
really trusts even though he knows he was a eath aid hermione had not spoken for 2
ten she was sitting with her  staring at her harry thought she too looked as though 1
though  he  muttered   can  you be worrying about her said in utter not worrying 1
about  hermione said to her just remember what  she said to me in the three know 1
things  about  ludo  that  your hair this is what she she reported his she knew 1
nformation to the death and winky a bad crouch would have been furious he got he 2
would  have  talked   but  bagman  pass information on did ermione fudge reckons 1
madame  maxime attacked ron turning back to said only saying that because crouch 1
disappeared near the eauxbatons never thought of did said ron definitely got giant 1
giant nd she want to admit course she said hermione looking what happened to hagrid 1
hagrid hen rita found out about his look at jumping to conclusions about because 2
part who needs that sort of probably say i had big knew what get for telling the 1
the  ermione looked at her done any she looking  were going to do the impediment 1
have  to  really  get  down  come you need to get some harry and ron went slowly 1
upstairs  to  their as harry looked over at nevilles true to his word to he had 1
bout neville s as harry took off his glasses and climbed into he imagined how it 2
must  feel to have parents still living but to sympathy from strangers for being 1
an but as he listened to that neville deserved it more than he lying in the harry 1
harry  ate toward the people who had tortured and he remembered the crowd as son 1
and  his companions had been dragged from the he understood how they had then he 1
remembered the face of

of  screaming  boy  and  realized  with  a  jolt that he had died a it was harry 1
staring  up  at the canopy of his bed in the came back to he was the one who had 1
torn these families these ron and hermione were supposed to be studying for their 1
their  day  of the third but they were putting most of their efforts worry about 1
hermione said shortly when harry pointed this out mind practicing on his own for 2
a  least  get  top  marks in dark never have found out about all these hexes in 1
training  for  when all said ron attempting the impediment  curse on a wasp that 1
had buzzed into the room and making the mood in the castle as they entered june became 1
became ooking forward to the third which would take place a was practicing hexes 2
at  every available he felt more confident either of the difficult and dangerous 1
though it would was harry had managed to find his way past monstrous creatures and 1
and  nd this time he had some some chance to prepare himself tired of walking in 1
on and ron all over the professor  had given them permission to use the empty transfiguration 1
transfiguration  oon  mastered the impediment a spell to slow down and the which 1
would enable him to blast solid objects out of his useful discovery of hermiones 2
that  would  make his wand to check whether he was going in the right direction 1
ith  the  shield  this  was  supposed to cast a invisible himself that deflected 1
minor  hermione  managed to shatter it and harry wobbled around the room for ten 1
minutes before

before  still  doing really hermione said looking down her list and crossing off 1
those spells they had already of these are

are and look at said who was standing by the he was staring down onto the malfoy 1
malfoy arry and hermione went to and goyle were standing in the  tree crabbe and 2
goyle seemed to be keeping a both  holding his hand up to his mouth and speaking 2
into looks like using a said harry  said told those sorts of things work around 1
around  ome she added turning away from the window and moving back middle of the 1
try that shield charm sirius was sending daily owls like he seemed to want to on 1
on  etting  harry  through  the last task before they concerned with he reminded 1
harry  in every letter that whatever might be going on was not nor was it within 1
his power to influence if voldemort is really getting stronger he my priority is 2
to  cannot  hope to lay hands on you while you are under but take no concentrate 1
on  getting  through  that maze and to other nerves mounted as june the drew but 1

onto  said  it was sort of he was but he kept running over hexes and spells 1
he had been practicing in his mind as he

he  could  remember  them all made him feel they walked onto the quidditch which 1
was  now completely a  hedge ran all the way around the edge of there was a gap 1
ntrance  to  the  vast  the  passage  beyond it looked dark and five minutes the 1
stands  had  begun  to  the  air was full of rumbling of feet as the hundreds of 1
students filed into their  and the first stars were starting to professor professor 1
professor  and  professor  flitwick came walking into the stadium and  they were 1
wearing luminous stars on their all except who had his on the back of his moleskin 1

pointed  his  wand   and  his  magically magnified voice echoed into the and the 1
third  and  final task of the triwizard tournament is  let me remind you how the 1
points currently tied in with each cedric diggory and harry both of hogwarts the 2
cheers  and  applause  sent birds from the forbidden forest fluttering into with 1
eighty  points  viktor  of durmstrang more in third  place fleur of beauxbatons 1
arry  could  just make out and hermione applauding halfway up the he waved up at 1
and  they waved beaming my harry and said he gave a short blast on his and harry 1
and  cedric  hurried  the towering hedges cast black shadows across the whether 1
tall  and  thick  or  because they had been the sound of the silenced the moment 1
they  entered the harry felt almost as he  he pulled out his and heard cedric do 1
the same just behind after about fifty they reached a they looked at each  harry 2
and  he  took  the left while cedric took the harry heard whistle for the second 1
krum had entered the  his chosen path seemed completely he turned and hurried holding 1
holding  igh over his trying to see as far ahead as there was in whistle blew in 1
the distance for the third all of the now

now  harry  kept looking behind the old feeling that he was was maze was growing 1
darker with every passing minute as the sky reached a second he whispered to his 2
holding it flat in his the wand spun around once and pointed toward his into solid 1
solid  and he knew that he needed to go northwest for the of  do was to take the 1
left  fork  and  go  right again as soon the path ahead was empty and when harry 1
reached  a  he  his  way  harry  know but the lack of obstacles was unnerving he 1
should  have  met  something  by  it felt as though the a sense of then he heard 1
movement right behind he held out

out  but  its  beam  fell only upon who had just hurried out of a  cedric looked 1
severely  the sleeve of his robe was he enormous only just got he shook his head 1
and dived out of along another keen to between himself and the harry hurried off 2
as  he  turned  a he dementor gliding toward twelve feet its face hidden by its 1
ands  it  sensing  its  way  blindly toward harry could hear its  he felt clammy 1
coldness stealing over but knew what he had to  he summoned the happiest thought 2
he  concentrated  with  all on  getting out of the maze and celebrating with ron 1
and his

his  a  silver  stag  erupted  from  the end of wand and galloped  fell back and 1
tripped over the hem of its harry had a he advancing in the wake of his silver 2
a  there  was  a  loud and the exploded in a wisp of the silver faded from harry 1
wished  it  could  have he could have but moved quickly and quietly as listening 1
his  wand  held  high once  left left twice he found himself facing dead he did 1
spell  again  and  found  that  he  was  going too far he turned odd golden mist 1
floating ahead of  harry approached it pointing the beam at this looked like some 1
some  e  wondered  whether  he might be able to blast it out of the e  the spell 1
shot  straight  through  the  leaving  it he supposed the reductor curse was for 1
solid  what  would happen if he was it worth chancing or should he double he was 1
still  hesitating  when  a  scream  shattered  the harry there was he stared all 1
around  what  had happened to her have come from somewhere he took a deep breath 1
and  ran the the world turned upside harry was hanging from the with his glasses 1
dangling  off  his  threatening  to fall into the he end of his nose and hung it 1
felt as though his feet were had now become the below him the heavens stretched he 1
he  elt  as  though  if  he tried to move one of his he would he told as all the 1
blood rushed to his  but not one of the spells he had practiced had been designed 1
designed  round  and did he dare move his he could hear the blood in two choices 1
and or send up red and get rescued and from he shut his so he be able to see the 2
view  of  endless  his  right  foot as hard as he could away from the grassy the 1
world  righted  harry fell forward onto his knees onto solid he felt temporarily 1
limp  with  he took a steadying again and hurried looking back over his shoulder 1
as he ran which twinkled innocently at him in the he paused at a junction of two 2
paths and looked around had been she who had what had she was she all there was no 1
no  parks  that  mean she had got herself out of or was she reach her harry took 1
the right fork with a feeling of but

but same he help one champion the cup was somewhere close and it sounded as though 1
though  got  this  what  if he actually managed to and for the  first time since 1
found himself he saw again that image triwizard cup in front of the rest of the 1
the  e  met nothing for ten but kept running into dead twice he wrong he found a 1
new  route and started to jog along his making his shadow flicker and distort on 1
the hedge then he found himself facing a cedric was right was ten feet it looked 2
more  like a its long sting was curled over its its thick armor glinted which he 1
pointed at

at  the  spell  hit  the armor and harry ducked just in but could burning it had 1
singed  the  top  of his the skrewt issued a flew forward toward harry the spell 1
hit the armor again and ricocheted harry staggered back a few paces and fell the 2
skrewt  was  inches from him when it froze had managed less harry pushed himself 1
away from it and in the direction impediment curse was not the skrewt would be the 1
the  legs  at  any  he  took  a left path and hit a dead a and hit forcing to he 1
performed  the  spell  and chose a path that would take him he had been hurrying 1
along the new path for a few when path running parallel to his own that made him 2
stop are you yelled the hell think  and then harry heard

heard  the air was suddenly full of harry began sprinting up  to find a way into 1
when  none  he  tried  the reductor curse very but it burned a small hole in the 1
hedge through which  at the thick brambles and branches until they broke and an 1
an  earing his and looking to his saw cedric jerking and on standing over  harry 1
pulled  himself up and pointed his wand at krum and began to harry the spell hit 1
krum in the he stopped dead in his fell  facedown in the over to who had stopped 2
twitching  and  there  his  hands  over  his  you all harry said grabbing panted 1
believe he crept up behind i heard i turned and he had his wand on cedric got he 2
was  still  he  and  harry  looked down at believe this thought he was all harry 1
staring at did said you hear fleur scream said said think krum got her

raised his wand and shot a  red sparks into the which hovered high above marking 2
the he harry and cedric stood there in the darkness for a looking ibetter go said 1
said  t  was  an  odd  he  and  cedric had been briefly united against they were 1
opponents came back to the two of them proceeded up then harry turned and cedric 2
footsteps  soon  died  harry  moved continuing to use the making sure he was in 1
ight  it  was  between  him and cedric his desire to reach the  burning stronger 1
than  but  he  could  hardly  believe  what just seen an unforgivable curse on a 1

pointed  him  to  the  he  dashed  saw light the triwizard cup was gleaming on a 1
plinth  a  hundred yards  hurtled out onto the path in front of cedric was going 1
to get there cedric was sprinting as  harry knew he would never catch cedric was 2
much  had  then harry saw something immense over a hedge to his intersected with 1
his it was moving so fast cedric was about  eyes on the had not seen it harry your 1
your cedric looked around just in time to hurl himself past  in his he harry saw 2
wand  fly  out  of his hand as a into the path and began to bear down upon harry 1
the  spell  hit  the  hairy black but for all the  good it he might as well have 1
thrown a stone at the spider at harry

harry  but  it  was  no  use  spider  was  either  so  or  so that the more than 1
aggravating  harry  had  one horrifying glimpse of eight sharp pincers before it 1
was  upon  he was lifted into the air in its front struggling he tried connected 1
with the pincers and next moment he was in he  yelling but his spell had no more 2
effect  than  raised his as the spider opened its pincers once more and shouted 1
it  worked  disarming  spell  made the spider drop but that twelve feet onto his 1
already injured which crumpled beneath  he aimed high at the as he had done with 2
the and shouted  as cedric yelled the same

same the two spells combined did what one alone had the over flattening a nearby 2
and  strewing  the  path  with a tangle he heard cedric all did it fall on harry 1
called he looked down at his it was bleeding he see some sort of gluey secretion 2
from the pincers on his he but his leg was shaking badly and did not want to support 1
support  asping for and looked cedric was standing feet from the triwizard which 1
was  gleaming harry panted to take but cedric he merely stood looking at then he 1
turned to stare harry saw the longing expression on his face in its golden harry 2
who  was  now  holding onto the hedge to support cedric a  take you should twice 1
saved  my  neck  in   not  how supposed to harry he felt his leg was very he was 1
aching  all  over  from trying to throw off the and after  him to just as beaten 1
harry  to  ask  cho  to  the one the telling not going to win any races on this 1
edric  took a few paces nearer to the stunned away from e  being said harry take 1
then  we can get out of cedric watched harry steadying holding tight to the told 1
me  about the cedric gone down in the first task if told me what was had help on 1
that  harry  trying to mop up his bloody helped me with the egg  had help on the 1
egg in the first said still said testing his leg it shook violently as he put weight 1
weight  e  had sprained his ankle when the spider had dropped got more points on 1
the second said cedric stayed behind to get all the i done  was the only one who 2
was thick enough to take that song take the aid he stepped over the tangled legs 2
to  join  who  stared  at  cedric  he  was  walking  away from the sort of glory 1
hufflepuff  house  in  cedric he looked as though this was costing him every but 1
his  face  was  his  arms were he seemed harry looked from cedric to the for one 1
shining  he  saw the holding he saw himself holding the triwizard cup heard the 1
aw  face  shining  with more clearly than he had ever seen it the picture and he 1
found himself staring at stubborn of harry

harry  take it at the same still a hogwarts tie for cedric stared at he 1
his  said  helped each other we both got just take it for a cedric looked as 1
though he believe his then his face in

in  he   he  grabbed harrys arm below the shoulder and helped harry the cup when 1
they had reached they both held a hand out over one of

of said  he and cedric both grasped a harry felt a jerk somewhere behind his his 2
feet  had  left the not unclench the hand holding the tri wizard it was pulling 1
nd swirling cedric at his hapter  and bone harry felt his feet slam into the his 2
injured  leg gave he let go of the triwizard cup at he raised his are he  cedric 1
shook his he got pulled harry to his and they they had left the hogwarts grounds 2
they had obviously traveled hundreds of miles even the mountains surrounding the 2
castle  instead  in  a  dark  and overgrown the black outline of a small church 1
eyond  a  large  yew  tree to their a hill rose above them  out the outline of a 1
fine  old  house on the  cedric looked down at the triwizard cup and then up at 1
nyone tell you the cup was a he said he was looking around the it was completely 2
silent  and  slightly  this supposed to be part of the said he sounded slightly 1
aid  glad  that cedric had made the suggestion rather than they pulled out their 1
harry  kept  looking  around  he  yet  the feeling that they were being he said 1
quinting  tensely  through  the  they  watched  the  figure steadily toward them 1
between  the  harry make out a but it walking and holding its he could tell that 1
it  was carrying was and wearing a hooded cloak pulled up over his head to paces 1
the  gap between them closing all the time saw in arms looked like a baby was it 1
merely a bundle of harry lowered his wand slightly and glanced sideways at cedric 1
cedric  hey  both  turned  back  to  watch  the  approaching it stopped beside a 1
towering  marble  only  six feet from for and cedric and the short figure simply 1
looked at one and without scar exploded with it was agony such as he felt in all 2
his  his  wand  slipped from his fingers as he he was on the ground and he could 1
see  nothing  at  his  from  far above his he heard a cold voice the  a swishing 1
noise and a second which screeched the words to

to  a  blast  of green light blazed through and he heard something ground beside 1
the pain in his scar reached such a pitch that he

he  terrified of what he was about to he opened his stinging cedric was lying on 1
the ground beside he was for a second that contained an harry stared into at his 1
his  blank  and  expressionless as the windows of a deserted at  looked slightly 1
and before mind had accepted what he was he could feel anything but numb he felt 2
himself  being to the short man in the cloak had put down his lit his and toward 1
the marble harry saw the name upon it flickering was forced around and slammed against 1
against  om  riddle  the cloaked man was now conjuring tight cords around tying 1
to  the  harry  could hear fast breathing from the depths of and the man hit him 1
him  with  a hand that had a finger  realized who was under the it was e but who 1
had finished conjuring the did not he was busy the  tightness of the his fingers 2
trembling  rumbling  over  the  that harry was bound so tightly to the headstone 1
that  he  length  of some black material from the inside of his and without a he 1
turned  from  harry and hurried harry make a nor could he see where wormtail had 1
he  turn his head to he could see only what was right in front of body was lying 1
some  twenty feet some way beyond glinting in  lay the triwizard wand was on the 1
ground  at  the  of   robes  that  harry had thought was a baby was close at of 1
tirring  harry  watched and his scar seared with pain and he that he want to see 1
what was in those robes want that he could hear noises at his he looked down and 2
saw  a  the  circling  the  headstone  where he was wheezy breathing was growing 1
louder  it  sounded as though he was forcing something  then he came back within 1
range of and harry saw him pushing to the foot of the it was full of what seemed 2
to be water around it was larger than any cauldron harry had ever a enough for a 2
man  to sit  the thing inside the bundle of robes on the ground was stirring was 1
trying  to  free  now  wormtail  was  busying  himself at of suddenly there were 1
crackling names beneath the large snake

snake  the liquid in the cauldron seemed to heat very the not  to send out fiery 1
as  though  it were on steam was the  wormtail tending the the movements beneath 1
the robes more heard the cold voice

voice the whole surface of the water was alight with sparks it

it is said the cold  wormtail pulled open the robes on the revealing what was

was  out  a  yell that was strangled in the wad of material his it was as though 1
wormtail  had  flipped  over  a  stone  and and  blind a hundred times the thing 1
wormtail had been carrying of  a crouched human except that harry had never seen 2
anything  less   hairless  and a reddish its arms and legs were thin and and its 1
face  child  alive  ever had a face like that and red the thing seemed almost it 1
raised its thin put them around and wormtail lifted as he did his hood fell and harry 1
harry  ale  face  in the firelight as he carried the creature  for one harry saw 1
the  flat face illuminated in the sparks on of the and then wormtail lowered the 1
creature  into  the there was  vanished below the harry heard its frail body hit 1
the with let it harry his scar burning almost past let it wormtail was his voice 2
he  seemed  frightened  beyond  his he raised closed his and spoke to the of the 1
unknowingly  you wil lrenew your  the surface of the grave at feet harry watched 1
as  a dust rose into the air at command and fell softly into the the  surface of 1
the water broke and it sent sparks in all

all  and now wormtail was he pulled a shining silver dagger  his his voice broke 1
into  petrified  the servant given will he stretched his right hand out in front 1
of  him  hand  with  the dagger very tightly in his left hand and swung it harry 1
realized  what wormtail was about to do a second it eyes as tightly as he but he 1
could  not block the scream through harry as though he had been stabbed with the 1
dagger  he  heard  anguished then a sickening as something was dropped  into the 1
harry  stand  to  but  the  potion had turned a the  of it shone through closed 1
ormtail was gasping and moaning with not until harry felt breath on his face did 2
he  realize that wormtail was right in of the forcibly you resurrect your  harry 1
could  do nothing to prevent he was tied too  hopelessly at the ropes binding he 1
saw  the  shining in remaining he felt its point penetrate the crook of his arm 1
leeve  of  his  torn  still panting with rumbled in his pocket and held it to so 1
that  a dribble of blood fell into he staggered back to the cauldron with harrys 1
he  poured  it   a blinding his job dropped to his knees beside the then slumped 1
sideways  and  lay  on the cradling the bleeding of gasping and the cauldron was 1
sending its diamond sparks in all so that it turned all else to velvety nothing 1
nothing  et  it  have  harry  let it have gone and the sparks emanating from the 1
cauldron  were  a  surge  of  white  steam  billowed  thickly  from the cauldron 1
obliterating  in   so that he see wormtail or cedric or anything but vapor in he 1
please let it be

be  but  through  the  mist  in  front  of he with an icy surge of of a tall and 1
skeletally rising slowly from inside the said the cold voice from behind the and 2
sobbing  and  still  cradling his mutilated scrambled to pick up the from got to 1
his  reached and pulled them over his the thin man stepped out of the staring at 1
and  harry face that had haunted his nightmares for three whiter than eyes and a 1
nose  that  was flat as a snakes with slits  lord voldemort had risen hapter the 1
death  eaters  voldemort looked away from harry and began examining his own pale 1
his long white fingers caressed his own his his the red whose pupils were like a 2
gleamed still more brightly through his hands and flexed the his expression rapt 2
and  he  took  not  the   of  who  lay twitching and bleeding on the nor of the 1
lithered  back into sight and was circling harry voldemort one unnaturally hands 1
into a deep pocket and drew out a he it and then he raised and pointed it at who 2
was  lifted  off  against  the headstone where harry was he fell to the foot and 1
voldemort  turned his scarlet eyes upon laughing a mirthless  robes were shining 1
with blood he had wrapped the stump of he you you did promise out your said voldemort 1
voldemort hank master he extended the bleeding but voldemort laughed ther please 1
please  voldemort  bent down and pulled out left he forced the robes up past his 1
and  harry  saw  something  upon  the  skin  like  a  tattoo  skull with a snake 1
protruding  from  its  mouth  image that  the quidditch world the dark voldemort 1
examined  it  ignoring  ncontrollable   is  he said will all have noticed and we 1
shall  see  we shall know  he pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on 1
he scar on harry s forehead seared with a sharp pain and a voldemort removed his 2
fingers from and harry saw that it

it  a  look of cruel satisfaction on his voldemort straightened stared around at 1
the  dark  many  will be brave enough to return when they feel he his eyes fixed 1
upon the how many will be foolish enough to  he began to pace up and down before 2
harry and eyes sweeping the after a minute or he looked down at harry a cruel nakelike 1
nakelike arry upon the remains of my late he hissed muggle

voldemort  stood in waiting for then eaters fell to his crawled toward voldemort 1
and kissed the master he the death eaters behind him did the each of them approaching 1
approaching  nd  kissing his before backing away and standing forming a enclosed 1
tom  riddle  s and the sobbing and twitching heap that yet they left gaps in the 1
as though waiting for more did not seem to expect he looked around at the hooded 2
and was no wind rustling seemed to run around the as though death said voldemort 2
thirteen years since last we yet you answer my call as though it were we are or are 1

silver  hung  shining  in  the  momentarily it writhed and  formed itself into a 1
gleaming replica of a human bright  downward and fixed itself upon wormtails bleeding 1
bleeding  sobbing  stopped  his breathing harsh and he raised his head stared in 1
disbelief  at  the  silver  now attached to his wearing a dazzling he flexed the 1
shining picked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it into he is thank thank 1

to  wormtail who had faked his own to out of hiding by those he had once counted 1
and  decided  to  to  me in the country where it had long been rumored i was met 1
along  the  wormtail  has a curious affinity with do you little friends told him 1
there  was  a  deep  in  an albanian that  small animals like themselves had met 1
their  deaths  by a his journey back to me was not was hungry one on the edge of 1
the  very  forest  where he had hoped to find he  and who should he meet but one 1
bertha a witch from the  see the way that fate favors lord this might have been 1
been  and  of  my last hope for but wormtail a presence of i never have expected 1
from  him  bertha jorkins to accompany him he overpowered her brought her to and 1
bertha  who might proved instead to be a gift beyond my wildest dreams a little 1
ecame  a veritable mine of told me that the triwizard tournament would be 1
at  me  that  she knew of a faithful death eater who would i only contact she 1
told  me  many  but  the  means  i  used  to  break upon her were and when i had 1
extracted all useful from body were both damaged beyond she had now served her i 2
not idisposed of voldemort smiled his terrible his red eyes blank and of was ill 2
adapted  for  as  all assumed him and would attract far too much attention if he 1
was  the  servant  poor wizard though he wormtail was able to follow the i which 1
would  return  me  to  a weak body of my a body i be  inhabit while awaiting the 1
essential  ingredients  for  true  spell  invention  little  help  from  my dear 1
voldemorts red eyes fell circling potion concocted from unicorn and the snake venom 1
venom  as  soon returned to an almost human and strong enough to  was no hope of 1
stealing  the  stone for i knew that would have seen to it that it was but i was 1
willing to chasing i set my sights lower would settle for my old ld knew that to 2
achieve  this is an old piece of dark the that tonight would need three powerful 1
one of them was already  flesh given by a meant that we would have to come where 2
he  was  but  the blood of a foe would have had me use any would  any wizard who 1
had  hated  me so many of them still i was to rise more powerful than i had been 1
when  i  had  i  wanted iwanted the blood of the one who had stripped me of for 1
rotection  his mother once gave him would then reside how to get at harry for he 1
has been better protected than protected in ways devised by dumbledore long when 2
it  fell  to  dumbledore  invoked an ancient to ensure the protection as his not 1
even  i  can touch him of there was the quidditch world i thought his protection 1
might be weaker away from  but i was not yet strong enough to attempt kidnap in of 1
of  inistry  and the boy would return to where he is under the nose of that fool 1
from  morning  until  so  how could i using bertha of use my one faithful death 1
stationed at to ensure that the name was entered into the  death eater to ensure 2
that  the  boy  won  the  tournament  he the  first cup which my death eater had 1
turned into a which beyond the reach of help and and into my waiting and here he 1
he  oy you all believed had been my voldemort moved slowly forward and turned to 1
face he raised

raised  it  was pain beyond anything harry had ever his very bones on was surely 1
splitting along his his eyes were rolling madly black to die  and then it was he 2
was  hanging  limply  in  the ropes binding him looking up into those bright red 1
eyes  through  a kind of ringing with the sound of the death ihow foolish it was 1
to suppose that this boy could

could than said i want there to be no mistake in harry escaped me by a lucky and 2
i  am  now  going  to prove my by in front of you when there is no dumbledore to 1
help  and  i  will give him his he will be allowed to and you will be in  is the 1
just a little he and the snake glided away the  grass to where the death eaters stood 1
stood  untie  and give him back his hapter priori incantatem wormtail approached 1
who scrambled to find his to support his  the ropes were wormtail raised his new 2
silver pulled out the gagging and with one cut through the bonds tying harry to 1
to  there was a split when harry might have considered running injured leg shook 1
under  him  as  he stood on the overgrown as forming a tighter circle around him 1
and so that the gaps where death eaters should have stood were wormtail walked out 1
out  ody lay and returned with which he thrust roughly into hand without looking 1
at  then  wormtail  resumed  his place in the have been taught how to harry said 1
voldemort his red eyes through the  at these words harry as though from a former 2
the  club   he  had attended briefly two years all he had learned there and what 1
use would it be to deprive voldemort of his even if he when he was surrounded by 2
death  outnumbered  by  at least to learned anything that could possibly fit him 1
for  he  knew  he which moody had always the unblockable avada kedavra was right 1
mother  was not here to die for him this he was quite bow to each said bending a 1
but keeping his snakelike face upturned to the niceties must be dumbledore would 2
you   show  bow to  the death eaters were laughing voldemorts lipless mouth was 1
he  was  not going to let voldemort play with him before give him that voldemort 1
raising  his  wand harry felt his spine curve as invisible hand were bending him 1
ruthlessly  and  the  death eaters han  said voldemort and as he raised his wand 1
the  pressure   harry  lifted  now  you  face  like a and the way your ather ow 1
oldemort  raised  his  and before harry could do anything could even he had been 1
hit  again by the cruciatus the pain that he no longer knew where he knives were 1
piercing  inch  his  his  head  was  surely going to burst with he was more ever 1
screamed  in his life and then it harry rolled over and scrambled to his he was 1
uncontrollably as wormtail had done when his hand had cut

cut  the wall of watching death and they pushed him back toward  little said the 1
nostrils dilating with little that you want me to do that do  harry he was going 2
to  die  like  those pitiless red eyes  so was going to and there was nothing he 1
could  do  he going to obey he going to asked you whether you want me to do that 1
said voldemort

voldemort  and harry for the third time in his the sensation of it was not to it 1
was  as though he were dreaming answer no no answer iwill said a stronger in the 1
back of his i just answer ido i say just answer

answer  and  these  words  burst from they echoed through the and the  state was 1
lifted  as  suddenly  as though cold water had been him aches that the cruciatus 1
curse  had  left all over his body rushed and what he was said voldemort and the 1
death eaters were not laughing say obedience is a virtue i need to teach you before 1
before  ittle  dose of voldemort raised his but this time harry was with the of 1
uidditch he flung himself sideways onto the he rolled the headstone of voldemort 2
s  and  he heard it crack as the curse are not playing said cold drawing  as the 1
death  eaters  cannot  hide  from  does this mean you of does this mean that you 1
would  prefer  me  to  finish  it  come out and then will be quick might even be 1
painless would not

not  harry  crouched  behind the headstone and knew the end had there help to be 1
and  as he heard voldemort draw nearer he it  beyond fear or he was not going to 1
die  crouching here a he was not going to die kneeling at voldemort s he was and 1
he was going to die trying to defend even if no was before voldemort could stick 2
his  snakelike face around the  gripped his wand tightly in his thrust it out in 1
front of acing  voldemort was as harry voldemort ajet of green light issued from 2
voldemorts  wand just as met in midair suddenly wand was vibrating as though an 1
harge  were surging through his hand seized up around he have wanted to a narrow 1
beam of light connected the two red  deep following the beam with his astonished 2
saw  that white fingers too were gripping a wand that was shaking and then could 1
have  prepared  harry  for  this  felt his feet he and voldemort were both being 1
raised  into  the  their  wands  of  shimmering golden they glided away from the 1
tombstone of came to rest on a patch of ground that was clear and of

of  they  were asking voldemort for they were closing reforming the around harry 1
and  the  snake  slithering  at their some of wands the golden thread connecting 1
harry  and voldemort though the wands athousand more beams arced high over harry 1
and  all  around  until they were enclosed in a a cage of beyond which the death 1
eaters circled like their

their voldemort shrieked to the death and harry saw his red eyes astonishment at 2
what was saw him fighting to break the thread  his wand with harry held onto his 2
wand  more  with  both  and  thread  remained nothing unless i command voldemort 1
shouted to

to  and  then  an  unearthly and beautiful sound filled the it was from  the web 1
vibrating around harry and it was a sound harry though he had heard it only once 2
before in his phoenix  it was the sound of hope to the most beautiful and welcome 1
welcome  is he felt as though the song were inside him instead he connected with 1
and it was almost as though a friend were break the iharry told the i know i but 2
no  sooner  had  he  became  much  harder to his wand began to vibrate more beam 1
between  him  and  voldemort  changed  too was as though sliding up and down the 1
thread  connecting  the  wands felt a his hand as the light beads began to slide 1
slowly  and  beams  movement  was  now  toward  from and he felt his wand as the 1
closest bead of light moved nearer to harrys wand grew so hot he feared it would 2
burst into the closer that wand he was sure his wand would not survive contact with 1
with  bout  to shatter under his fingers  he concentrated every last particle of 1
his  mind upon forcing the his ears full of phoenix his eyes and very the beads 1
o  a  and  just  as  they began to move the other and it wand that was vibrating 1
voldemort  who  looked  and almost one of the beads of light was inches from the 1
tip  of harry understand why he was doing know what it might but he he had never 1
done  in  his  life  on  forcing that bead of very slowly moved along the golden 1
thread trembled for a

a  at  voldemorts  wand  began to emit echoing screams of then red  eyes widened 1
with shock smoky hand flew out of the tip of the hand he had made more shouts of 2
and then something  began to blossom from voldemorts wand a grayish that looked 1
looked  ere made of the densest it was a now a chest and the edric if ever harry 1
might  have  released his wand from it would kept him clutching his wand so that 1
the thread of golden  though the thick gray ghost of cedric diggory it a it looked 1
looked  emerged in its entirety from the end of voldemort s as it  itself out of 1
a very narrow and this shade of cedric and

and  the  golden  thread  of  and  t   its voice was distant and harry looked at 1
voldemort  wide  shocked  had  no  more  expected  this  than  harry very harry 1
frightened  yells of the death prowling around the edges of more screams of pain 1
from  the and then something else from dense shadow of a second quickly followed 1
by  arms  and  torso old  only in a dream was now pushing himself out of the and 1
his  or  his  or  whatever  it  fell next to and surveyed and the golden and the 1
connected  with  mild  leaning  on his alking was a real the old man his eyes on 1
that  one  you fight but yet another head was emerging this gray as a smoky both 1
arms shaking now as he fought to keep his wand ground and straighten up like the 1
the  he  shadow  of  bertha  jorkins surveyed the battle before  let she and her 1
voice echoed like cedrics as though from let him get harry let she and the other 2
two  shadowy figures began to pace the while the death eaters flitted around the 1
outside  of  and whispered as they circled the whispered words of encouragement 1
words  harry hear to  and now another head was emerging from the tip of and when 1
he saw it who it would be as though he had expected cedric had appeared from the 2
because  the man appearing of more than any other the smoky shadow of a tall man 1
with untidy hair fell to  straightened and looked at and his arms shaking madly looked 1
looked he ghostly face of his he said wants to see you will be all hold

hold  and  she  first  her then her a young woman with long shadowy form of lily 1
potter  blossomed  from the end of to and straightened like her she walked close 1
to  looking   spoke  in  the  same echoing voice as the but so that his face now 1
livid  with  fear  as his victims prowled around could the connection is we will 1
linger  for  only  but  we  will  give you must get to the it will return you to 1
hogwarts you  harry fighting now to keep a hold on his which was and beneath his 1
his  hispered  the figure of my body will take my body back to my  said his face 1
screwed  up with the effort of holding the it whispered his ready to do it harry 1
he  think  he  could  have  held  on  for another pulled his wand upward with an 1
almighty and the golden the the phoenix song died the shadowy figures of victims 1
victims  isappear  were  closing in upon shielding harry from his gaze and harry 1
ran as he had never run in his knocking two

two  he zigzagged behind feeling their curses following hearing them  headstones 1
was dodging curses and pelting toward no longer  the pain in his his whole being 2
concentrated  on what he had he heard voldemort ten feet from harry dived behind 1
a  marble  angel  to  avoid  the  the  tip of its wing shatter as the spells hit 1
gripping  his  wand   behind  the  angel  he  pointing  his wand wildly over his 1
shoulder  at  the  death running at  from a muffled he thought he had stopped at 1

flew  over  his  head  as  he  stretching out iwill kill he is shrieked hand had 1
closed  on   one tombstone stood between him and but cedric was too  and the cup 1
was  out  of  reach  red eyes flamed in the harry saw his mouth curl into a saw 1
aise  his  harry  pointing his wand at the triwizard it flew into the air toward 1
harry caught it by the handle he heard voldemort s scream of fury at the same moment 1
moment  hat  meant  the portkey had worked was speeding him away in cedric along 1
with  they  were  going hapter eritaserum  harry felt himself slam flat into the 1
his face was pressed filled his he had closed his eyes while the portkey and he 1
he  losed he did not all the breath seemed to have been was swimming so badly he 1
felt  as though the ground beneath him  to hold himself he tightened his hold on 1
the two things  cold handle of the triwizard cup and he felt as he away into the 2
blackness  gathering at the edges of his brain if and exhaustion kept him on the 1
breathing  in  the  smell  of   someone  to do something to and all the his 1
burned  a  torrent  of  sound deafened and confused there were voices  he 1
remained where he his face screwed up against the as  nightmare that would  then 2
a pair of hands seized him roughly and turned him

dumbledore  in  his  wand at that harry fully understood for the first time why 1
nly  wizard  voldemort had ever the look upon face as he at the unconscious form 1
of  moody was more terrible than harry there was no benign smile upon no twinkle 1
in  the  eyes  the  there was cold fury in every line of the ancient a sense of 1
umbledore as though he were giving off burning he stepped into the placed a foot 2
underneath moodys and him over onto his so that his face was snape followed the 1

and  until  he fell asleep and have to think there was a soft rush of fawkes the 1
phoenix  had  left  his and landed on said harry he stroked the beautiful fawkes 1
blinked peacefully up at there was something about

him arry felt a rush of gratitude toward but dumbledore no he leaned forward toward 1
toward  ery  harry  raised  his head and looked into those blue ithought i could 1
help  dumbledore said putting you into an sleep and allowing you to postpone the 1
moment  when  you   happened  i would do but i know numbing the pain for a worse 1
when  you  finally  feel  you  have  shown  bravery  beyond  i  of  i ask you to 1
demonstrate your courage one more i to

to the phoenix let out one quavering it shivered in the and a drop of hot liquid 2
had slipped down his throat into his and

and  he  took  a  deep  breath and began to tell as he visions passed that night 1
seemed  to  rise  before  his  he  saw  the  had revived he saw the death eaters 1
apparating  between  the  he   saw lying on the ground beside the once or sirius 1
made  a  noise as though about to say his but dumbledore raised his hand to stop 1
and  harry  was glad of because it was easier to keep going now he had it was a 1
hough something poisonous were being extracted from it was him  determination he 2
had to keep yet he sensed that once he

he  when  harry  told  of  wormtail  piercing  his  arm  with  the  let vehement 1
exclamation  and  dumbledore stood up so quickly that walked around the desk and 1
told harry to stretch out his harry  where his robes were torn and the cut beneath 1
beneath  aid my blood would make him stronger than if used someone told said the 1
protection  my  mother  left  in  me have it and he right could touch me without 1
hurting he touched my

my  for  a fleeting harry thought he saw a gleam of something but next harry was 1
sure  he had imagined for when dumbledore had returned to his seat behind the he 1
looked as old as he sitting down has overcome that particular

particular  harry  went  he  explained how voldemort had emerged from the and he 1
could  remember of speech to the death then he told how untied returned his wand 1
to  and prepared to but when he reached the part where the golden beam of light 1
e  found  his  throat he tried to keep but the memories of  what had come out of 1
wand  were flooding into his he could see see the old bertha jorkins his  he was 1
glad  when  sirius broke the  wands he looking from harry to  harry looked up at 1
dumbledore  on  whose  face there was e his eyes gazed into and it was almost as 1
though  an  beam shot between reverse spell said sirius said wand and voldemorts 1
wand  share  each  of them contains a feather from the tail of the same this in 1
pointed  at the perching peacefully on  feather came from harry  said ollivander 1
wrote to tell me you had bought the the moment you left his shop four years what 2
happens when a wand meets its said will not work properly against each said the owners 1
owners  f the wands force the wands to do battle very rare effect one will force 1
the  other  to regurgitate spells it has the then those which preceded he looked 1
interrogatively  at  and harry said dumbledore his eyes upon some form of cedric 1
must  have  harry  nodded   came back to said sirius spell can reawaken the said 1
dumbledore  that  would  have  is akind of reverse a shadow of the living cedric 1
would have

have  spoke  to  harry  he  was  suddenly shaking the ghost or  whatever he said 1
retained  appearance  and i am guessing other such forms less recent victims of 1
ld  harry  his  throat  still   said dumbledore aid  grip on shoulder was now so 1
tight  it  was  last  murders  the  wand said reverse more would have of had you 1
maintained  the  very  these these what did they harry described how the figures 1
that had emerged from the had

had  made its final at this harry found he could not he looked around at sirius 1
ad his face in his harry suddenly became aware that fawkes had left his the had 1
had  t  was resting its beautiful head against injured and were falling from its 1
eyes  onto  the wound left by the the leg was will say it said dumbledore as the 1
phoenix rose into the the perch beside the have shown bravery beyond anything i of 1
of  ou you have shown bravery equal to those who died at  height of his you have 1
shouldered  a  grown  burden and it you have now given us all we have a right to 1
you  will hospital i do not want you returning to the dormitory a would you like 1
to stay with sirius nodded and stood he transformed back into the dog  harry and 2
dumbledore  out  of  the accompanying them down a ospital when dumbledore pushed 1
open  the  harry  saw  and  hermione  grouped around a madam they appeared to be 1
demanding to where harry was and what had happened to all of them around and the 2
black  dog  and  weasley let out a kind of muffled h she started to hurry toward 1
but  dumbledore moved between he holding up a listen to me for a harry has been 1
through  a terrible ordeal he has just had to relive it and and if he would like 1
you all to stay with he looking at  and bill may do but i do not want you questioning 1
questioning  o  and  certainly  not this weasley she was very she rounded on and 1

black dog that was i

harry  will  wait  while  you  get  into  harry  felt  an inexpressible sense of 1
gratitude  to  dumbledore for question it as though he want them but the thought 1
of  it all over the idea of reliving it one more was more than he could  will be 1
back  to  see  you  as  soon  as  i  have met with would like you to remain here 1
tomorrow  until  i  have spoken as madam pomfrey led harry to a nearby he caught 1
sight of  motionless in a bed at the far end of the his wooden leg and edside he 2
harry   be  said madam giving harry some pajamas and pulling screens he took off 1
his  pulled  on  the  and  got into and the black dog came around the screen and 1
settled in of ron and hermione were looking at him almost as though all he told 1
told easleys eyes filled with tears as she smoothed his

his  madam who had bustled off to her returned holding a of purple potion and a 1
eed  to drink all of she a potion for dreamless  harry took the goblet and drank 1
a  few  he  felt  himself  at  everything around him became the lamps around the 1
hospital to him in a friendly way through the screen around his his  deeper into 2
the  warmth  of  the feather before he could the  say another his exhaustion had 1
carried  him  off to harry woke so so very that he open his wanting to drop  the 1
room was still dimly he was sure it was still and have been asleep very  then he 2
heard whispering around wake him if they shut are they shouting nothing else can 2
have  can harry opened his eyes someone had removed his he could see outlines of 1
weasley and bill close weasley was on her she minerva but what are they arguing 1
arguing  ow  harry  could  hear them people shouting and running the but all the 1
minerva  cornelius  fudge  was  saying   should never have brought it inside the 1
yelled  professor   dumbledore  finds  out  harry heard the hospital doors burst 1
unnoticed  by  any  of of whom were staring at the door as bill pulled back ack 1
udge came striding up the professors mcgonagall and snape were fudge demanded of 1
of  ot  said  weasley  is  a  hospital you think  do better to  but the door and 1
dumbledore came sweeping up the has said dumbledore looking from fudge to professor 1
professor re you disturbing these surprised at you asked you to stand guard over 2
barty  crouch is no need to stand guard over him she minister has seen to  harry 1
had  never seen professor mcgonagall lose control like were  of color in her and 1
a  hands  were  balled  into she was  we told fudge that we had caught the death 1
eater  responsible  said  in  a  low  he seemed to feel his personal safety was 1
ummoning  a dementor to accompany him into the he brought  barty crouch told him 1
you  would  not  mcgonagall told him you would never allow dementors to set foot 1
inside  the but dear roared who likewise looked angrier than harry had  minister 1
of it is my decision whether i wish to bring me interviewing a possibly dangerous 1
dangerous  ut professor voice drowned moment that thing entered the she pointing 1
at trembling all swooped down on crouch and

and  harry  felt a chill in his stomach as professor mcgonagall  what had he did 1
not  need  her to finish her he knew the have it had administered its fatal kiss 1
to barty it had sucked his he was worse than all he is no blustered seems he has 2
been responsible for several

several  he  cannot  now  give  said he was staring hard at as though seeing him 1
plainly  for the first cannot give about killed those  he killed no is blustered 1
was  a  raving  from what minerva and severus have told he seems to have all on 1
voldemort  was  giving  him  dumbledore  peoples  deaths  were mere of a plan to 1
restore  voldemort  to full the voldemort has been restored to his  fudge looked 1
as  though someone had just swung a heavy  he stared back at dumbledore as if he 1
quite  believe  what  began  to  still  goggling at come dumbledore  minerva and 1
severus  have  doubtless told said heard barty crouch  under the influence of he 1
told us how he was smuggled of and how voldemort of his continued existence from 2
bertha to from his father and used him to capture the plan i tell  voldemort to 1
to  aid  and harry was astonished to see a slight smile dawning on his seriously 1
believe that come come crouch may have believed himself to be acting upon but to 2
take  the  word  of a lunatic like dumbledore harry touched the triwizard cup he 1
was transported to said dumbledore witnessed lord i will explain it all to you if 1
if  you  will  step up to my  dumbledore glanced around at harry and saw that he 1
was  but  am  afraid  i cannot permit you to question harry curious smile he too 1
glanced at then looked back at and are to take word on are there was a which was 2
broken by sirius his hackles were and he was baring his teeth at  i believe said 2
his  eyes were blazing heard  and i heard account of what happened after he the 1
two  stories  make  they  explain everything that has happened disappeared last 1
udge still had that strange smile on his once he at

at  are  prepared to believe that lord voldemort has on the and a boy fudge shot 1
harry another and harry suddenly  been reading rita he said and bill all none of 2
them had realized that harry was

was fudge reddened but a defiant and obstinate look came over

over  if i he looking at i have discovered that been keeping certain facts about 1
the  boy  very  a and having all over the place assume that you are referring to 1
the pains harry has been dumbledore  admit that he has been having these said fudge 1
fudge  ossibly  to  said taking a step toward and once he seemed to radiate that 1
indefinable  sense  of power that harry  stunned young is as sane as you or that 1
scar upon his his i believe it hurts him when lord voldemort is close or

or  fudge  had  taken  half  a step back from but he looked no forgive but never 1
heard of a curse scar acting as an alarm

alarm  i  saw voldemort come harry he tried to get out of weasley forced him saw 1
the death i can give you their lucius snape made a sudden but as harry looked at 2
eyes  flew back to was said visibly very old family to excellent causes arry now 1
working for the

the are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of thirteen years 2
said  fudge  could  have found those names in old for heavens dumbledore boy was 1
full  of  some crackpot at  year too tales are getting and still swallowing them 1
boy  can   and  you  still think  professor mcgonagall these deaths were not the 1
random work of a see no evidence to the shouted now matching her his seems to me 2
that you are all determined to start a panic have worked for these last thirteen 1
thirteen  harry believe what he was he had always thought of as alittle a little 1
but  essentially  but  now a angry wizard stood before to accept the prospect of 1
disruption  in  comfortable  and  ordered world believe that voldemort could has 1
dumbledore  you accept that fact  and take the necessary we may still be able to 1
save  the  essential  step  is to remove azkaban from the control of the shouted 1
fudge  the  be  kicked out of office for suggesting half of us only feel safe in 1
our  beds  at  we standing guard at rest of us sleep less soundly in our knowing 1
that  you  most dangerous supporters in the care of creatures who will join asks 1
said  will  not  remain  loyal  to voldemort can offer  them much more scope for 1
their  powers  and their pleasures behind and his old supporters returned to you 1
will be to  regaining the sort of power he had thirteen years  fudge was opening 2
and closing his mouth as though no

no  second  step you must take at dumbledore pressed to send to he  to the fudge 1
finding  his tongue madness is them the hand of before it is too said  voldemort 1
will  persuade  as  he  did  that he alone among will rights and their cannot be 1
fudge  shaking  his  head  and retreating further from the magical community got 1
wind  that  i  had  approached  the  dumbledore of my career  are said his voice 1
rising the aura of power around him his eyes blazing once the love of the office 2
you  you  place too much and you always have on the purity of you recognize that 1
it  matters  not what someone is but what they just destroyed the last remaining 1
member of a family as old man chose to make of his i tell you nowtake the steps 1
steps  n  office or as one of the bravest and greatest ministers of  fail to act 1
history  will  remember  you as the man who voldemort a second chance to destroy 1
the  world  we  have to whispered still backing and then there was madam pomfrey 1
was  standing frozen at  her hands over her weasley was still standing over her 1
o  prevent him from and hermione were staring at your determination to shut your 1
eyes will carry you as far  have reached a parting of the you must act as you see 1
see  act  as  i  see   voice  carried  no  hint of a it sounded like a mere but 1
bristled  as  though  dumbledore  were  advancing upon him with  see he waving a 1
threatening given you free had a lot of respect for i might not have agreed with 1
with  ept  there  many  have  let  you hire or keep or decide what to teach your 1
students without reference to the but

but  only  one against whom i intend to said lord if you  are against then we on 1
the  same  it  seemed fudge could think of no answer to he rocked and small feet 1
for  a  moment and spun his bowler hat in his he plea in his be he just be snape 1
strode  past  pulling  up the left sleeve of his robes stuck out his forearm and 1
showed  it to who  said snape the dark it is not as clear as it was an hour when 1
it  burned  but  you  can  still see every death eater had  by the dark it was a 1
means  of distinguishing one and his of to when he touched the mark of any death 1
we  were  to and at his this mark has been growing clearer all karkaroff s think 1
karkaroff  fled  we  both felt the mark we both knew karkaroff fears the dark he 1
betrayed  too  many  of  his  fellow   be sure of a welcome back into the  fudge 1
stepped  back  from  snape  he  was  shaking  his  he did in a word snape had he 1
apparently  repelled by the ugly mark  looked up at dumbledore and know what you 1
and your

your but i have heard i have no more to i will be in with to discuss the running 2
of  this  i  must return to the he had almost reached the door when he he turned 1
strode  back   and  stopped  at   he  said taking a large bag of gold out of his 1
pocket  it  onto harrys bedside thousand there should have been a but under the 1
e  crammed  his  bowler hat onto his head and walked out of behind the moment he 1
had dumbledore turned to look at the

she  was  white  to the but she looked know what fudge fondness for muggles that 1
has held him back at  ministry all these fudge thinks he lacks proper wizarding 1

be  notified  and he is well placed to those  who are not as shortsighted as  go 1
to  said standing go said him what has tell him i will be in direct contact with 1
him  he  will  need  to  be  if fudge thinks i am at the ministry it to said  he 1
clapped a hand on kissed his mother on the pulled on and strode quickly from the 1
the  aid  turning  to professor want to see hagrid in my  office as soon as also 1
she  will  consent  to  come  professor  mcgonagall  nodded  and left without a 1
umbledore  said to madam you be very kind and go down to  professor moodys where 1

snape  other with the utmost will in the short said with a bite of impatience 1
his  lack  of open you will shake you are on the same side unless the few of 1
us  who  know the truth do not stand there is  for any very slowly still glaring 1
at  each  other  as though each the sirius and snape moved toward each other and 1

aid  e  looked  slightly  paler  than and his black eyes good said and he with a 1
trace  of  apprehension  on  his  as snape swept wordlessly after it was several 1
minutes before dumbledore spoke  must go he said must see the harry the rest of your 1
your will see all of you harry slumped back against his pillows as dumbledore and 1
and  easley were all looking at none of them spoke for a got to take the rest of 1
your  weasley  said  at  her hand the sack of gold on his bedside cabinet as she 1
reached a good long try and think about something else for a think about  to buy 2
with your want that said harry in an expressionless have anyone  i have won it been 1
been  the  thing  against  which  he  had  been  fighting on and off he maze was 1
threatening to overpower he could feel a prickling corners of his he blinked and 2
stared up at the your weasley told him to take the cup with said now the burning 2
feeling  was  in  his  throat  he wished ron  weasley set the potion down on the 1
bedside bent and put her  he had no memory of ever being hugged like as though by 1
by  f everything he had seen that night seemed to fall in upon  his mother s his 1
the sight of dead on the ground all in his head until he could hardly bear until 2
he  was  up  his  misery  fighting  to get out of  there was a loud slamming and 1
weasley and harry broke was standing by the she was holding something tight in her 1
her he  said weasley wiping her eyes on the back of her

her  harry  drank  it  in  one the effect was irresistible waves dreamless sleep 1
broke  over  he fell back onto his pillows no  chapter seven the beginning  when 1
he  looked  even  a  month harry found he had only scattered  next few it was as 1
though  he had been through too much to  recollections he did have were very the 1
was  the meeting  diggorys that took place the following  they did not blame him 1
for what had on the both him returning body to diggory sobbed through most of the 1
the  rief  seemed  to be beyond suffered very little she when harry had told her 1

gryffindor  tower  the  following  from  what  and  dumbledore had spoken to the 1
school that morning at he that they leave harry that nobody ask him questions or 2
badger  had  happened  in the most he were skirting him in the avoiding his some 1
whispered  behind  their hands as he he guessed that believed rita article about 1
how  disturbed  and possibly dangerous were formulating their own theories about 1
how  cedric  had  he liked it best when he was with ron and hermione and they or 1
else  letting  him  sit  in  silence  while  they  played he them had reached an 1
understanding  they  need to put into was some some of what was going on outside 1
hogwarts  that  it   speculate  about  what might be coming until they knew for 1
ouched  upon  the subject was when ron told harry about dumbledore before going 1
ent to ask him if you could come straight to us you to go back to the at least at 1
at  aid  said got his said shaking his head suppose got to trust the only person 1
apart  from  ron  and  hermione  that  harry  felt there was no longer a defense 1
against  the  dark  arts  they used the one on thursday afternoon to go down and 1
visit in  sunny fang bounded out of the open door as they barking and

and called coming to the he strode out to meet pulled harry into a ruffled his

at  the sound of the he said like ter come visit the skrewt with i  was he added 1
seeing the looks on their  it was with a heavy heart that harry packed his trunk 2
up  in  the   his  return to privet he was dreading the leaving which a when the 1
winner  of the championship would be he had avoided being in the great hall when 1
it  was full ever since preferring to eat when it was nearly empty to avoid the 1
hen and hermione entered the they saw at once that the usual were the great hall 2
was  normally  decorated with the winning leaving there were black drapes on the 1
wall  behind  the  harry knew instantly that they were there as a mark of to the 1
real  moody  was  at the staff table his wooden leg  in he was extremely jumping 1
every  time  someone spoke to blame moodys fear of attack was bound to have been 1
increased  by   imprisonment in his own professor karkaroff s chair was as  down 1
with the other where karkaroff was and whether up with

with  madame  maxime  was  still  she was sitting next to they further along the 1
sitting  next to professor was his eyes  lingered on harry for a moment as harry 1
looked at his looked as sour and unpleasant as harry continued to watch long ooked 1
ooked  hat  was  it  that  snape  had  done  on  dumbledores  the night  and was 1
dumbledore  so  convinced  that snape was truly on had been their dumbledore had 1
said so in the snape had great personal was that the job he had taken up had he made 1
made ith the death pretended that he had never really gone he had like voldemort 2
biding his musings were ended by professor who stood up at the staff great which 2
in  any  case had been less noisy than it was became very said looking around at 1
them  another he and his eyes fell upon the hufflepuff theirs had been the most 1
efore  he  had  gotten to his and theirs were still the and is much that i would 1
like to say to you all said i acknowledge the loss of a very fine who should be he 1
he  our  feast with i would like you to and raise your to cedric they did all of 1
the  benches  scraped  as  everyone  in  the  and in one rumbling harry caught a 1
glimpse  of  cho  through the there were he looked down at the table as they all 1
sat down  was a person who exemplified many of the qualities that dumbledore was 2
a  good  and  loyal a hard he valued fair his death has affected you whether you 1
knew  him  well to know exactly how it came harry raised his head and stared at 1
iggory  was  murdered  by  lord  apanicked  whisper  swept the great people were 1
staring  at  he  looked  perfectly  calm  as  he watched them mutter themselves 1
inistry  of dumbledore not wish me to tell you it is  possible that some of your 1
parents  will be horrified that i not believe that lord voldemort has or because 1
they  think  young as you it is my that the truth is generally to any attempt to 1
pretend  that cedric died as the result of is an insult to his stunned and every 1
face  in  the  hall  was  turned toward or every over at the slytherin harry saw 1
draco  malfoy muttering to and harry felt a sick swoop of anger in his he forced 1
himself to

to  is somebody else who must be mentioned in connection with dumbledore went am 1
of  about harry  a kind of ripple crossed the great hall as a few heads flicking 1
back  to face  potter managed to escape lord said risked his own life  to return 1
body  to  he in every the sort of bravery few  wizards have ever shown in facing 1
lord and for i

i  dumbledore turned gravely to harry and raised his goblet  great hall followed 1
they  murmured  his as they had murmured but through a gap in the standing harry 1
saw  that  and of the other slytherins had remained defiantly in their their who 1
after  all possessed no magical did not see when everyone had once again resumed 1
their dumbledore triwizard aim was to further and promote magical in the light of 1
of appened lord voldemorts return ties are more important than dumbledore looked 2
from  madame  maxime  and  to  fleur delacour beauxbatons to viktor krum and the 1
durmstrangs  at the looked almost as though he expected dumbledore to say  guest 1
in this said and his eyes lingered upon the  be welcomed back here at any should 2
they wish to i say once again the light of lord we are only as strong as weak as 2
we  are  lord  voldemorts  gift  for  spreading discord and can fight it only by 1
showing  an  equally  strong  bond of and and language are nothing at all if our 1
aims  are  identical   is  my  beliefand never have i so hoped that i am we are 1
ifficult some of you in this hall have already suffered at many of your families 2

a  choice  between  what  is  right  and what is remember what happened to a and 1
because he strayed across the path of lord remember

crowded  entrance hall with the rest of would take them back to hogsmeade it was 1
another beautiful  that privet drive would be hot and its flower beds a riot the 2
thought gave him no pleasure at
