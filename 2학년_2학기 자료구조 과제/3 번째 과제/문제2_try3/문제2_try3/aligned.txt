many  years  since  the  riddle family had lived it stood on some of its windows 1
tiles  missing  from its and ivy over once a and easily the largest and grandest 1
building for miles the riddle house was now the little hagletons all agreed that 1
the old house was half strange and horrible had happened something that the older 2
liked  to  discuss  when  topics  for  gossip  were  the  story  so and had been 1
embroidered in so many that nobody was quite the was every version of the started 2
in  the same fifty years at daybreak on a fine morning when the riddle house had 1
still  a  maid  had  entered the drawing room to find all three the maid had run 1
screaming down the hill into the.

village there with their eyes wide cold as still in their dinner the police were 1
and  the whole of little hangleton had curiosity and nobody wasted their breath 1
pretending  to  feel about the for they had been most elderly and riddle had and 1
and their had if all the villagers cared about was the identity of their murderer 2
three  did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same the hanged the village 1
did  a  roaring trade that the whole to have turned out to discuss the they were 1
rewarded  for  cook  arrived  dramatically  in their midst and announced to man 1
called frank bryce had just been cried several frank bryce was the he lived alone 1
in  a  cottage on the of the riddle frank had come back from the war with a very 1

anyone  in  little  hangleton doubted that killed the but over in the neighboring 1
town of great in the dark and frank was stubbornly again and that he was and that 2
the  he  had seen near the house on the day of the deaths had and nobody else in 1
the  village  had seen any such and sure frank had invented just when things were 1
looking very serious for the report on came back and changed the police had never 1
read  an  odder a team of doctors had the concluded that none of the riddles had 1
been  or  far  as  they  could harmed at in fact report in a tone the riddles all 1
appeared  to  be  in perfet health from the fact all the doctors did note though 1
determined to find something wrong that each of the riddles had a look of terror 1
upon his whoever heard of three people being frightened to as there was no proof 1
that  the  riddles  had  been  murdered at frank the riddles were buried in the 1
little  objects  of curiosity for a to and amid a cloud of bryce returned to his 1
cottage  on  the grounds of the far as he killed and i care what the police said 1
dot  in  the hanged if he had any leave knowing as how we knows he but frank did 1
not he stayed to tend the garden for the riddle and then the next neither family 1
stayed perhaps it frank that the new owners said there was a nasty feeling started 2
to  fall  into the wealthy man who owned the riddle house these days neither they 1
said  in  the  village that he kept it for though these might the wealthy owner 1
continued to pay frank to do was nearing his seventh birthday very his bad leg stiffer 1
e seen pottering around the flower beds in fine even creep up on try as he might 2
to  suppress  weeds  were  not  the  only things frank had to contend a habit of 1
throwing  stones through the windows of the over the lawns frank worked so hard 1
to keep once or house for a they knew that old devotion to the house almost to an 2
and  it  amused  them  to see him limping stick and yelling croakily at for his 1
believed the boys like their parents and though him a so when frank in august and 2
saw  something  very  odd  up  at  the old he the gone one step further in their 1
attempts to punish it was bad leg that woke it was paining him worse than ever up 1
and  limped  downstairs  into  the kitchen with the idea of his stiffness in his 1
standing  at the filling the he looked saw lights glimmering in its upper frank 1
knew at had broken into the house and judging by the flickering quality started a 1
rank  had  no  in  any  he  had  deeply  mistrusted  the police taken him in for 1
questioning about the he put down back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would and 2
was  soon and removing a rusty old key from its hook by the he picked was propped 1
against the and set off into the front door of the riddle house bore no sign of 1
being of frank limped around to the back of the house until he reached by took out 2
the  old  put  it into the and opened the door he let himself into the cavernous 1
frank  had  not entered although it was very he remembered where the door groped 1
his  way  towards  his nostrils full of the smell of footsteps or voices from he 1
reached  the  which  was  a little large mullioned windows on either side of the 1
front and to the dust that lay thick upon the because it muffled the on the frank 1
turned  and  saw  at  once where the intruders of the passage a door stood and a 1
flickering light shone of gold across the black frank edged closer and he was the 2
room  the he now had been lit in the this surprised then and listened for a voice 1
spoke within the it sounded timid is a little more in the my if you are still said 2
a  second this too belonged to a man it was strangely and cold as a sudden blast 1
of  icy something about that on back of neck stand me closer to frank turned his 1
right  ear  toward the the better to came being put down upon some hard and then 1
the  dull  scraping noise a dragged across the frank caught a glimpse of a small 1
his to chair into he was wearing a long black and there was then he went out of sight 1
s said the cold my said the first voice set out to explore the.

i  will  milk her before we said the second will the the journey has tired brow 1
frank  inclined  his  good  ear  still  closer to was a and then the man called 1
wormtail  spoke  may  i  ask how long we are going to said the cold the place is 1
moderately and the plan cannot proceed it would be foolish to act before the frank 2
inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and he had heard the word which was not a 2
word at quidditch world my said dug his finger still more vigorously into his but 1
do  not  understand  should we wait world cup is at this very moment wizards are 1
pouring into the country and every meddler from the ministry of magic will be on on 1
susual checking and they will be obsessed with lest the muggles notice so we frank 2
stopped  trying  to  clear  out  his  he  had distinctly heard and each of these 1
expressions  meant  something  and frank could think of only two sorts of people 1
frank  tightened  his  hold on his walking stick once and more lordship is still 1
wormtail  said  iam  there  was  a note of menace in the cold voice aslight pause 1
followed  the wormtail the words tumbling from though he was forcing himself to 1
say  this  before  he  lost could be done without harry my another more and harry 1
breathed the second voice ido not say this out of concern for the said his boy is 2
nothing  to nothing at it is merely that if we were witch or wizard wizard thing 1
could  be  done  so  much more if to leave you for a short while know that i can 1
disguise  myself  back here in as little as two days with a suitable person could 1
use another said the cold voice is it makes said sounding thoroughly relieved hands 1
n  harry  potter  would be so he is so well protected so you volunteer to go and 1
fetch me a i perhaps the me has become wearisome for could this suggestion of the 2
be  nothing more than an attempt to desert ihave no wish to leave none at not lie 1
to hissed the second can always you are that you ever returned to i revolt i see 2
you flinch when you my devotion to your lordship devotion is nothing more than you 2
would not be here if else to how am i to survive without when i need feeding.

few you seem so much my lord breathed the second am no and a few days alone would 2
be  to  rob  me  of  the  little  health  i have regained under your who had been 1
sputtering fell silent at for a few frank could hear nothing but the fire the the 2
second  man  spoke  once  in  was almost have my reasons for using the as i have 1
already to and ihave waited thirteen a few more months will make no as protection 1
surrounding  the  i believe my plan will be all that a courage from wormtail you 1
will unless you wish to feel lord wrath imust said panic in his voice through our 2
journey  i have gone over the plan in my head bertha disappearance unnoticed for 1
and  if  we if i murder whispered the second if you follow the the ministry need 1
ever  know  that  anyone else has you will do it quietly i could do it but in my 1
present one more death and our to harry potter is i am not asking you to do it by 1
ave  rejoined  us  am  a  faithful  said  the merest trace of sullenness in ineed 1
somebody  with somebody whose loyalty has never and fulfill found said and there 1
was  definitely  a sulky edge to his the one who found i brought you is said the 1
second  sounding  stroke of brilliance i would thought possible from wormtail if 1
truth be you were not aware she would be when you caught were thought she might be 2
my  lord  said  the second voice the cruel amusement more pronounced than ido not 1
deny  that  her information was without i could formed our and for you will have 1
your i will allow you an essential task for one that many of my followers.

would my what wormtail sounded terrified you want me to spoil the your part will 1
come at the but i promise you will have the honor of being just as voice suddenly 1
sounded as though his mouth had gone very are to kill me said the cold voice would 2
i  kill  i killed bertha because i had she was fit for nothing after my quite in 1
wkward  questions  would have been asked if she had gone that she had met you on 1
her  wizards  who  are supposed to run into ministry of magic witches at wayside 1
ormtail  muttered  something  so quietly that frank could not man laugh entirely 1
mirthless cold as his could have modified her but memory charms can be broken as i 2
proved when i questioned it would be an insult to her information i extracted from 1
ut  in the frank suddenly became aware that the hand slippery with the man with 1
the  cold  voice  had  without  any kind of remorse he was dangerous and he was 1
lanning  more  murders harry whoever he was in danger frank knew what he must if 1
was the time to go to the out of the house and head straight for the telephone box 1
peaking  and  frank remained where he frozen to the more my faithful servant at 1
harry potter is as good as it is there will be no more but i think i hear and the 1
second  voice  he  started  making  noises  such as he was hissing and spitting 1
without  drawing frank thought he some sort of fit and then frank heard movement 1
behind  him in the dark he found himself paralyzed with something was slithering 1
toward him along the dark corridor sliver of he realized with a thrill of terror 1
that  it  was a frank stared as its undulating body cut a curving track the thick 1
dust  on  the coming closer and closer was he to escape was into the room where 1
the  two  men  sat plotting yet the snake would surely kill him but before he had 1
made his the snake was level with and it was it was following the hissing noises 1
made by the beyond the and in the tip of its tail had.

vanished  there was sweat on forehead and the hand on the walking inside the the 1
cold  voice was continuing to and frank was impossible this man could talk frank 1
understand  what  was  going  he  wanted  more than anything to bed with his the 1
problem  was  that  his  legs  seem to want to stood there shaking and trying to 1
master the cold voice.

to has interesting it my said the to there is an old muggle standing right outside 2
this listening to every word we frank have a chance to hide there were footsteps 1
and then was flung wide abalding man with graying a pointed and watery eyes stood 1
mixture of fear and alarm in his him where are your the cold voice was coming from 2
the ancient armchair before the the the on the other was curled up on the rotting 2
horrible travesty of a pet wormtail beckoned frank into the though still deeply frank 1
n his walking stick and limped over the the fire was the only source of light in 1
the  it cast upon frank stared at the back of the the man inside it seemed to for 1
frank even see the back of his heard said the cold that calling said frank for now 2
that he was inside the now that the time had come for some sort of he.

felt am calling you a said the voice means that you are not a know what you mean 1
by  said  his voice growing i know is heard enough to interest the police i done 1
murder  and  planning and tell youthis he on a sudden wife up and if i come back 1
ave  no  said te cold very knows you are you nobody that you were do not lie to 1
lord for he he.

always that said frank is i think much of your my turn and face me like a why iam 1
not  a  said the cold barely audible now over the the am much more than a why i 1
will  face  come  turn  my  chair the servant gave a eard with his face screwed as 1
though  he  would  rather have done than his master and the hearth rug where the 1
snake the small man and turn the the snake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed 1
nagged on its and then the chair was facing and he saw what was sitting in to the 1
floor  with a he opened his mouth and let out that he never heard the words the 1
thing  in the chair as green a rushing and frank bryce he was dead before he two 1
hundred  miles  the boy called harry potter woke with chapter the scar harry lay 1
flat  on  his  breathing  hard as though he had been avivid dream with his hands 1
pressed  over  his  the  old  scar shaped like a bolt of was burning beneath his 1
fingers as pressed a wire to his he sat one hand still on his the other hand reaching 1
hich were on the bedside he put them on and his bedroom amisty orange light that 1
was filtering through the.

the  harry ran his fingers over the scar it was still he turned scrambled out of 1
crossed  the  opened his and peered into inside of the a skinny boy of fourteen 1
looked back at his under his untidy black he examined the scar of his looked but 1
it  was  still harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before there 1
had been two people he knew and one he concentrated trying to the dim picture of a 2
darkened room came to there had been a small man called nicknamed and a high the 1
voice of lord harry felt as though an ice cube had slipped down into his he closed 2
his  eyes  tightly and tried to remember what had but all harry knew was that at 1
the moment when chair and had seen what was sitting in he had felt a spasm of or 1
had that been the pain in his and who had the old man for there had definitely been 1
im  fall to the it was all becoming harry put his face out his trying to hold on 1
to  the  picture of that dimly lit keep water in his cupped the details were now 1
trickling to voldemort and wormtail had been talking about ry could not remember 2
the  and  they  had  been plotting harry took his face out of his opened his and 1
stared  around  his expecting to see something unusual as it there was an number 1
nusual things in this a large wooden trunk stood open a black and assorted rolls 1
of  parchment  littered that part of his desk that was not taken up by the empty 1
cage in which usually on the floor beside his bed a book lay harry had fell asleep 2
last  the  pictures  in  this  book  were all men zooming in and out of sight on 1
throwing  a  red  ball harry walked over to the picked it and watched on of the 1
goal  by  putting the ball through a then he snapped the book quidditch the best 1
sport  in  the  world  distract  him at he placed flying with the cannons on his 1
bedside  crossed to the curtains to survey the street privet drive looked exactly 1
as a respectable suburban street early hours of saturday all the curtains were as 2
far  the there a living creature in not even a and and harry went restlessly back 1
to the bed and sat down on over his scar it the pain that bothered harry was no stranger 1
e  had lost all the bones from his right arm once and same arm had been pierced 1
by a venemous fang not long only ry had fallen fifty feet from an airborn he was 1
used to they were unavoidable if you attended hogwarts school of and and knack for 2
attracting a lot of the thing that was bothering harry was the last time his cause 2
voldemort had been close but voldemort be the mort lurking in privet drive harry 2
listened  closely to the silence around was he stair or the swish of a and then 1
he jumped slightly tremendous grunting snore from the next harry shook himself he 2
was  being  there  was no one in the except uncle aunt and and they were plainly 1
still  their dreams untroubled asleep was the way harry liked the dursleys it as 1
though  any  to  him uncle aunt and dudley were only living they were muggles who 1
hated  and  despised  magic in any which welcome in their house as dry they had 1
explained away over the last three years by telling everyone that he bly criminal 2
they knew perfectly well as an underage harry to use magic outside but they were 1
still  apt to blame him about the harry had never been able to confide in them in 1
the wizarding the very idea of going to them when they his scar hurting and about 2
his  worries  about was and yet it was because of voldemort that harry had if it 1
been  for  harry  would not have had the lightning on if it been for harry would 1
still have harry had been a year old the night that voldemort for awizard who had 2
been  gaining power steadily for eleven killed his father and voldemort had then 1
turned  his wand curse that had disposed of many witches and wizards in his to it 1
had  not instead of killing the small the curse had upon harry had survived with 1
nothing but a shaped cut on his demort had been reduced to something barely his 1
powers his voldemort had the terror in which the secret community of and had lived 2
for so long had followers had and harry potter had cit had been enough of a shock 2
for  harry  to  on his that it had been even more disconcerting to find out that 1
world  knew his harry had arrived at hogwarts to find that lowed him wherever he 1
but he was used to it at the starting his fourth year at and harry was already the 1
ack  at  the castle but there was still a fortnight to go before he went back to 1
round his room and his eye paused on the birthday cards at the end of what would 1
they say if harry wrote.

to at hermione voice seemed to fill his shrill and scar really write to professor 2
and go check common magical ailments and maybe something in there.

about  that  would  be  go straight to the headmaster of and in consult a harry 1
stared  out of the window at the inky very much whether a book could help him as 1
far  as he he to have survived a curse like it was highly that he would symptoms 1
listed in common magical ailments and as for harry had no idea where dumbledore 1
went during the picturing with his long silver full length and pointed stretched 1
out  on  a  beach rubbing suntan lotion onto his rever dumbledore harry was sure 1
that hedwig would be able to owl had never yet failed to deliver a letter to even 2
without  dear  professor sorry to bother but my scar hurt this harry even inside 1
his head the words sounded and so he tried to imagine his other best ron and in a 1
ed hair and freckled face seemed to swim before.

a  scar  but  be near you can i mean be trying to do you in i maybe scars always 1
twinge  a  weasley was a fully qualified wizard who worked in the misuse fice at 1
the ministry of but he have any particular in far as harry in any harry like the 1
idea of the whole that was getting jumpy about a few weasley would fuss than and 1
fred and twin might think harry was losing his the weasleys were favorite family 1
in  the  he  was  might  invite him to stay any time now had mentioned the and he 1
somehow  want  his  visit  punctuated  with  anxious inquiries harry kneaded his 1
forehead  with  his what he really wanted it shameful to admit it to was someone 1
like  like  a an advice he could ask without feeling someone who cared about who 1
ience with dark and then the solution came to it was so and so that had taken so long 1
arry  leapt  up from the hurried across the and sat at piece of parchment toward 1
loaded his quill with wrote dear wondering how best to phrase his still marveling 2
at thought of sirius straight but perhaps it so surprising found out that sirius 1
was his godfather two months there was a simple reason for complete absence from 1
life  then had been in the terrifying wizard jail guarded by fiends who had come 1
to search for sirius at hogwarts when he rius had been innocent murders for which 2
he had been had whom nearly everybody now believed and hermione knew they had come 2
with  wormtail  only  the  though only professor dumbledore had believed for one 1
glorious  harry had believed that he was the at rius had offered him a home once 1
his name had been but away from him had escaped before they could take him sirius 2
had had to flee for his harry had helped him on and since sirius had been on the 1
the  home harry might tail had not escaped had been haunting him all it dursleys 1
knowing that he had so nearly escaped sirius had been of some help to even if he 2
be with due to sirius that harry now had all his school things never allowed this 2
their general wish of keeping harry as as with their fear of his had led them to 1
lock  his  school in stairs every summer prior to but their attitude had changed 1
arry  had  a  dangerous murderer for a godfather harry had them that sirius was 1
arry  had  received two letters from sirius since he had at been not by owls was 1
usual  with  but by brightly colored hedwig had not approved of these flashy she 1
had  been them to drink from her water tray before flying off on the they put him 1
in mind of palm trees and white and he was never in case the letters were he was 1
enjoying  harry  found  it  hard to imaging dementors surviving for long in that 1
irius had gone which were now hidden beneath the highly floorboards under sounded 2
and  in  both of them he had harry call on him if ever harry needed he needed to 1
right all lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light that into the when the 2
sun had when his bedroom walls had turned when sounds of movement could be heard 1
from uncle vernon cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of parchment and reread dear 1
hanks  for  your  last  that bird was it could hardly get things are the same as 1
usual diet going too my aunt gling doughnuts into his room they told him have to 1
cut keeps doing so he got really angry and chucked his out of computer thing you 1
can play games bit stupid now he mutilation part three to take his mind off mainly 2
because  the  dursleys  are  terrified you might turn up bats if i ask you aweird 1
thing happened this my scar hurt last time that was because voldemort was at but 2
i  reckon he can be can do you know if curse scars sometimes hurt years send this 1
with hedwig when she gets off hunting at the say buckbeak for thought that looked 2
all  there  was  no point putting in the want it to look as though he was too he 1
folded  up the ready for when hedwig then he got to his and opened his drobe once 1
without glancing at his reflection he started to o chapter the.

invitation  by  the  time  harry arrived in the the three dursleys none of them 1
looked  up  as  he  entered  or  sat uncle behind the daily and aunt petunia was 1
cutting  a  grapefruit  pursed  over  her horselike dudley looked furious and and 1
somehow  seemed to be taking this was saying as he always took up an entire side 1
hen  aunt  petunia  put  a  quarter of unsweetened grapefruit a mulous you diddy 1
dudley  glowered  at his life had taken pleasant turn since he had come home for 1
the summer with uncle vernon and aunt petunia had managed to find excuses petunia 1
always  insisted  that  dudley  was  a  very gifted boy whose while uncle vernon 1
maintained that want some swotty little they also skated over the accusations of 1
bullying in the a but he hurt a aunt petunia had said at the bottom of the report 1
there were a few comments from nurse that not even uncle vernon and aunt petunia 1
could  no aunt petunia wailed that dudley was and that his poundage that he was a 1
growing boy who needed plenty of the stock knickerbockers big enough for him the 1
school  nurse eyes sharp when it came to spotting fingerprints on her serving the 1
comings  and  goings  of  the neighbors refused to that extra dudley had reached 1
roughly the size and weight of a young so many after arguments that shook bedroom 2
and  many  from  aunt petunia new regime had the diet sheet that had ings school 1
nurse  had  been taped to the which had been of things drinks and chocolate bars 1
and  burgers  and  filled  with tables and the sorts of things that uncle vernon 1
called  to  about  it  aunt petunia had insisted that the whole family grapefruit 1
quarter to he noticed that it was a lot smaller seemed to feet that the best way 1
to  keep up morale was get more to eat than but aunt petunia know what was hidden 1
under the loose she idea that harry was not following the diet at the moment was 1
expected to survive the summer on carrot harry had sent to pleas for and they had 2
risen to the occasion hedwig had house with a large box stuffed full of parents were 1
he  hogwarts had obliged with a sack full of his own touched he had had too much 1
experience of had sent the family with an enormous fruitcake and meat poor who was 2
elderly and had needed a full five days to the and then on birthday the dursleys 1
had  completely he had ceived four superb birthday one each from and harry still 1
ad  two  of  them and looking forward to a real breakfast his grapefruit without 1
ncle vernon laid aside his paper with a deep sniff of and gthis he said grumpily 1
to  aunt petunia gave him a severe and then nodded pointedly at finished his own 1
grapefruit quarter and was eyeing with.

a uncle vernon gave a great which ruffled his bushy and.

up the doorbell uncle vernon heaved himself out of his chair and quick as a while 2
his mother was occupied with the.

of  harry  heard talking at the and someone and uncle vernon then the front door 1
and the sound of ripping paper came aunt petunia set the teapot down on the table 2
and looked to vernon had got she have to wait long to find after looked he barked 1
at  the wondering what on earth he was supposed to have done and followed uncle 1
vernon out of the kitchen and into door sharply behind both of he marching over to 2
the  fireplace  and turning to face harry to pronounce him under harry would have 1
dearly loved to have but he feel that uncle temper should be tested this early in 2
the especially when strain from lack of he therefore settled for looking just said 2
uncle  he  brandished  a  piece  of purple writing paper aconfusion who would be 1
writing  to  uncle vernon about know who sent letters by uncle vernon glared at 1
then looked down at the letter and dear we have never been but i am sure you have 2
heard  a deal my son as harry might have told the final of the quidditch world and 1
my has just managed to get prime tickets through the department of magical games and 1
do  hope  you will allow us to take harry to the as a britain hosted the cup for 1
thirty and tickets are we would of course be glad to have harry stay for the see 2
him  safely  onto  the  train back to it would be best for harry to send us your 1
answer  as  quickly  because the muggle postman has never delivered to our and i 1
where  hoping  to  see yours molly weasley ido hope put enough stamps uncle vernon 1
finished  put  his  hand  back  into his breast and out hing at he he held up the 1
envelope in which letter had and harry had aevery bit of it was covered in stamps 2
except for a.

on  weasley had squeezed the address in minute did put enough stamps said trying 1
to  sound  as  though was a mistake anyone could his eyes postman he said through 1
gritted interested to know where ter came he why he rang the seemed to think it was 1
arry  say other people might not understand why uncle a fuss about too many but 1
harry had lived with the touchy they were about anything even slightly out of the 1
omeone would find out that they were connected with.

like uncle vernon was still glaring at who tried to keep his do or say anything 1
he  might  just  be in for the treat non to say but he merely continued to harry 1
decided  to  igo  he aslight spasm crossed uncle large purple the mustache he knew 1
what  was going on behind the a furious battle as two fundamental instincts came 1
into  allowing  harry  to  go would thing uncle vernon had struggled against for 1
thirteen on disappear to the for the rest of the summer would get rid anyone could 2
have and uncle vernon hated having harry thinking it he looked down at letter is 1
this he staring at the signature seen said my friend she was meeting him off the 1
og the school train at the end of last he had almost said and that was a sure way 2
to  get  his  nobody ever mentioned the name of school aloud in the dursley uncle 1
vernon screwed up his enormous face as though.

to  sort  of  he growled of children with harry he thought it was a bit rich of 1
uncle  vernon  to own had finally achieved what been threatening to do since the 1
and  become wider than he uncle vernon was perusing the letter he muttered under 1
his  is  this  harry felt a second stab of ahe said on all said uncle vernon harry 1
with some that his cle looked vaguely apparently his nerves stand the sound of in 1
his  living he took refuge in perusing the letter harry words us your answer the 1
normal  does  she normal for said and before his uncle could stop he normal for 1
ncle  vernon  looked  as  outraged  as  if harry had just uttered with he shot a 1
nervous  look  through the as though expecting neighbors with their ears pressed 1
against  the  many times do i have to tell you not to mention that under his face 1
now a rich plum stand in the clothes petunia and your ungrateful back after dudley 2

upon  that he want to they were soon caught up in the crowds now flooding out of 1
aucous  singing  was  borne  toward  them  on  the  night  air  as along the and 1
leprechauns kept shooting over their their when they finally reached the nobody 1
felt  like  sleeping  level  of  noise around weasley agreed that they could all 1
gether before turning they were soon arguing enjoyably drawn into a disagreement 1
about  cobbing with and it was right at the tiny table and spilled hot chocolate 1
all  over  the  verbal  replays and insisted that everyone go to hermione and and 1
harry  and  the rest of the weasleys changed into and from the other side of the 1
campsite they could still.

to stop who was on a top bunk above lay staring up at the of watching the glow of 1
an occasional leprechaun lantern flying and of more spectacular he was itching to 2
get back on his wronski somehow oliver wood had never managed to convey.

with  grams what that move was supposed to look harry saw in on the and imagined 1
the sensation of hearing a strong crowd do voice echoed throughout the give harry 1
never  knew whether or not he had actually dropped off like krum might well have 1
slipped  into actual dreams he weasley was ron on get this is harry sat up quickly 1
and the top of his head hit e he could tell that something was the noises in the campsite 1
inging had he could hear and the sound of people he from the bunk and reached for 2
his but who had pulled on his own harry grab a jacket and get outside harry did as 2
he  was  told and hurried out of the ron by the light of the few fires that were 1
still he could fleeing something that was moving across the field toward emitting 1
odd  flashes of light and noises like loud roars yells were drifting toward then 1
came a burst of strong.

the a crowd of tightly packed and moving together with wands was marching slowly 1
across  the  harry  squinted at they seem then he realized that their heads were 1
hooded and their faces along in four struggling figures were being contorted into 1
hough the masked wizards on the ground were and the people rionettes operated by 1
invisible strings that rose from the into were very more wizards were joining the 1
marching  laughing  and  pointing tents crumpled and fell as the marching crowd 1
once or twice marchers blast a tent out of his way with his several.

the  the floating people were suddenly illuminated as they passed recognized one 1
of  the campsite the other three looked as they might be his wife and one of the 1
marchers below down with his her nightdress fell down to reveal and cover herself 1
up as the crowd below her screeched and ron watching the smallest muggle who had 2
begun  to  spin  a  sixty  feet  above the his head flopping limply from side to 1
hermione and ginny came hurrying toward pulling weasley right behind at the same 2
and  percy  emerged  fully with their sleeves rolled up and their wands going to 1
help  the  weasley shouted over all the rolling lot into the and stick come and 1
fetch you when sorted this and percy were already sprinting away toward the oncoming 1
easley  tore  after  ministry  wizards  were dashing from every of the the crowd 1
beneath  the  roberts  family  was  said grabbing hand and starting to pull her 1
toward  and george they all looked back as they reached the beneath the roberts 1
family was larger than they could to through it to the hooded wizards in the but 1
they were.

having  though  they were scared to perform any spell that the colored lanterns 1
that  had  lit the path to the stadium were blundering through the children were 1
anxious shouts were reverberating around them in the cold night harry felt thither 2
by  people  whose  faces  he  could  not then he heard said hermione stopping so 1
abruptly  that harry walked where are oh this is stupid she illuminated her wand 1
and directed its narrow beam across sprawled on the over a tree he said getting to 2
his  feet  with feet that hard not said a drawling voice from behind and hermione 1
turned  draco  malfoy  was standing alone against a looking utterly his arms he 1
seemed  to  have scene at the campsite through a gap in the ron told malfoy to do 1
something that harry knew he.

thing he could find was his ibelieve lost.

around but his wand was nowhere to be back in the said it fell out of your pocket 1
when  we  were  hermione  suggested aid he usually kept his wand with him at all 1
times  in  the  wizarding  without it in the midst of a scene like this made him 1
rustling noise nearby made all three of them winky the was way out of a clump of 1
bushes  she  was  moving in a most great it was as though someone invisible were 1
trying  to  hold  her is bad wizards she squeaked distractedly as she leaned and 1

prop up rotten and unjust just because too lazy another loud bang echoed from the 2
edge  of  the just keep shall said and harry saw him glance edgily perhaps there 1
was  truth  in  what  malfoy  had perhaps hermione they they set off harry still 1
searching his even though.

he  they  followed the dark path deeper into the still keeping and they passed a 1
group  of  goblins  who  were  cackling a undoubtedly won betting on the and who 1
seemed  quite  by farther still along the they walked into a patch of and looked 1
through  the they saw three tall and beautiful veela by a gaggle of young all of 1

sounds of the veela and had they were in the very heart of the they seemed to was 2
much  harry looked reckon we can just wait you hear anyone coming a ile the words 1

somebody standing just beyond the range of his hand without the silence was rent 1
by a voice unlike any and it not a panicked but what sounded like.

of  what  looked  like emerald with its mouth like a as they it rose higher and 1
blazing  in  etched  against  the  black  sky like a new the wood all around them 1

appearance of the to illuminate the entire wood like some grisly neon he who had 1
conjured  the  but  he  see  he called come hermione had seized the collar of his 1
jacket and.

as hard as.

the  clearing before they had taken a few hurried nounced the arrival of twenty 1
appearing from harry whirled and in an he registered one each of wand and every 1
wand  was pointing right at and without pausing to he he seized the other two and 1
pulled  them down onto the roared twenty voices was a blinding series of flashes 1
hair  on  his  head ripple as though a powerful wind had tion of an inch he saw 1
jets of fiery red light flying over one bouncing off tree rebounding into the darkness 1
elled a voice he hair stopped blowing he raised his head a little the wizard in 1
im had lowered his he rolled over and saw.

were  all  staring  at for a few his eyes blazing in his white face as he stared 1
down  at  then come to life he said he moved quickly around diggory and strode off 1
toward.

the diggory called after no one else but crouch did not seem prepared to take his 2
word  for  they  around  and the rustling of leaves as he pushed the diggory said 1
looking  down  at  unconscious imean off said weasley seriously think it was the 1

voices  as  they  approached the spot where reached they found a great number of 1
witches  and  the  all  clamoring  to  get away from the campsite had a hurried 1

front  came ward still wearing her bedroom her face pale and a copy daily prophet 1
clutched in been so she flung her arms around weasley and the daily prophet onto 1
the  looking  harry saw the scenes of terror at quidditch world complete with a 1
twinkling photograph of mark over the all weasley muttered releasing weasley and staring 1

useless  if  you wanted to know the but otherwise it golden and each of them was 1
engraved  with  one of were no numerals around the but descriptions of where and 1

that muggle taxi drivers rarely and pigwidgeon was making an earsplitting nor did 2
it  help  fabulous  start  fireworks went off unexpectedly when trunk causing the 1
driver carrying it to yell with fright and.

pain the the journey was owing to the fact that they were jammed in the taxis with 2
their crookshanks took quite a while to time they entered and hermione were all 1
severely they were very relieved to get out at even though the rain was coming and 2
they got soaked carrying their trunks across the harry was used to getting onto 1
platform nine and by it of walking straight through the apparently solid barrier 2
dividing tricky part was doing this in an unobtrusive so as did it in groups and 1
hermione most since they were panied by pigwidgeon and went they leaned casually against 1
ing and slid sideways through and as they did platform nine quarters materialized 2
in front the hogwarts a gleaming scarlet steam was already clouds billowing from 1
through  which the many hogwarts students and peared like dark pigwidgeon became 1
noisier  than ever in response owls through the and hermione set off to find and 1
were  their luggage in a compartment halfway along the they then platform to say 1
to and might be seeing you all sooner than you said as he.

hugged  said  fred said tell percy i mentioned til such time as the ministry sees 1
fit  to release after isort of wish i were back at hogwarts this said ing almost 1
wistfully at the said george going to have an interesting said his eyes might even 2
get off to come and watch a bit of bit of said but at that the whistle and weasley 1
chivvied them toward for having us to said hermione as they climbed on closed the 1
and leaned out of the window to talk to thanks for said it was my said invite you 1
for  i expect all going to want to stay at what one thing and said ron three know 1
that  we find out this i said going to be very citing very glad changed the rules 1
aid  and  sure professor dumbledore will tell athe pistons hissed loudly and the 1
train began to us happening at fred bellowed out of the window as and charlie sped 2
away from rules are they but weasley only smiled and before the train had rounded 1
nd  charlie  had  and hermione went back to their the thick rain splattering dows 1
made  it very difficult to see out of ron undid his and flung them over cage to 1
muffle.

his  wanted to tell us happening at he said sitting down to the world but my own 1
mother  wonder  what  hermione whispered pressing her finger to her lips and the 1
ompartment next to harry and ron and heard a familiar drawling in through the open 1
ather actually considered sending me to durmstrang rather than knows the you you 1
know  his  opinion  of dumbledore such durmstrang admit that sort of but mother 1
like the idea of me going to school so far father says durmstrang a than hogwarts 1
about the dark durmstrang students actually not rubbish we hermione got tiptoed to 2
the compartment and slid it.

out  he  thinks  durmstrang  would  have suited does she then we have to put up 1
another  wizarding  said  said hermione got a horrible according to an appraisal 1
fmagical education in it puts a lot of emphasis on the think heard of said ron is 2
what  nobody  do said raising her aid traditionally been a lot of rivalry between 1
all the magic and beauxbatons like to conceal their whereabouts so nobody can.

said  off said starting to got to be about the same size hogwarts are you going 1
to  hide  a  great big hogwarts is said in knows everyone read a said go on hide a 1
place like said a muggle looks at all they see is a moldering old with a sign over 2
the entrance saying do not just look like a ruin to an outsider said it might have 2
charms on like the world cup and to keep foreign wizards from finding have made.

it  you  can enchant a building so impossible to plot on a if you say said ithink 1
durmstrang  must  be somewhere in the far very because got fur capes as part of 1
think of the said ron been so easy to push malfoy off a glacier and make it look 1
like  an shame his mother likes the rain became heavier and heavier as the train 1
moved  the  the windows so steamy that the lanterns were lit by the lunch the and 1
harry  bought a large stack of cauldron cakes several of their friends looked in 1
on  them  as  the  seamus dean and neville a extremely forgetful boy who had been 1
brought up by his formidable witch of a seamus was some of its magic seemed to be 2
wearing off it was but in a very feeble and exhausted sort of after half an.

or  growing  tired  of  the  endless  quidditch buried herself once in grade and 1
started  trying  to  learn  a  summoning  neville  listened  jealously  to  the 1
conversation as they want to he said buy it sounded.

amazing said at he rummaged in his trunk up in the luggage rack and.

pulled  said  neville enviously as ron tipped krum onto his saw him right up as 1
said were in the top box the first and last time in draco malfoy had appeared in 1
the  behind him stood crabbe and thuggish both of whom appeared to have grown at 1
least  a  evidently  they had overheard the conversation through the compartment 1
eamus  had left remember asking you to join said harry what is said pointing at a 1
sleeve of dress robes was dangling from swaying with the motion of.

the  ron made to stuff the robes out of but malfoy was too for sleeve and at said 1
malfoy  in  holding  up robes and showing crabbe you thinking of wearing were i 1
mean  were  very  fashionable  in about eighteen said the same color as the dress 1
robes  as  he  snatched of malfoy howled with derisive crabbe and goyle guffawed 1
oing  to  going  to try and bring a bit of glory to the money involved as you be 1
able to afford some decent robes.

if are you talking snapped you going to malfoy suppose you you never miss a chance 2
to  show  do  explain what on about or go said hermione over the of the standard 1
book of a gleeful smile spread across pale face tell me you he said got a father 1
and  brother  at  the  ministry  and you even my my father told me about it ages 1
cornelius  but  always  associated with the top people at be your too junior to 1
know  about  they  probably  talk  portant stuff in front of laughing once malfoy 1
beckoned to crabbe and and the three.

of ron got to his feet and slammed the sliding compartment lass said hermione and 2
she pulled out her muttered and the glass shards flew back into a single pane and 2
back into the making it look like he knows everything and we ways associated with 2
the  top  peopie at the dad got a he just likes it where course he said hermione 1
let malfoy get to.

ron get to as said picking up one of the remaining cauldron squashing it into bad 2
mood  continued  for  the rest of the he talk much as their school and was still 1
glowering  when  the  hogwarts express finally stopped in the of hogsmeade as the 1
train  doors  there was a rumble of thunder hermione up crookshanks in her cloak 1
and  ron left his dress robes over heads bent and eyes narrowed against the the 1
rain was now down and fast that it was as though buckets of water were.

being  harry  seeing a gigantic silhouette at the far end of the hagrid bellowed 1
yeh  at  the  feast  if  we first years traditionally reached hogwarts castle by 1
sailing  across  ifancy crossing the lake in this said hermione shivering as they 1
inched  slowly  along  the dark platform with the of carriages stood waiting for 1

few moments a the long procession of carriages was rumbling and splashing its ogwarts 1
hapter  the  triwizard through the flanked with statues of winged and up riages 1
swaying  dangerously in what was fast becoming a harry could see hogwarts coming 1
its  many  lighted windows and ing behind the thick curtain of lightning flashed 1
across  the  halt before the great oak front which stood at the top had occupied 1
the  carriages  in  front  were already hurrying up and neville jumped down from 1
their  carriage  and  dashed  up  ing  up  only when they were safely inside the 1
entrance its cent marble said shaking his head and sending water that keeps going 1
to  a  balloon  had  dropped  from out of the ceiling onto head drenched and ron 1
staggered  sideways  into  just as a bomb dropped missing it burst at sending a 1
wave  of  ter  over  his sneakers into his people all around them and another in 1

that  has  not  been  held  for  over pleasure to inform you that the triwizard 1
tournament  will be joking said fred weasley the tension that had filled the hall 1
ever since arrival nearly one and dumbledore am not he now that you mention i did 2
hear  an  lent  one  over  the  summer  about  a a and a leprechaun who professor 1
mcgonagall cleared her maybe this is not the said was ah wizard some of you will 2
not  know  what  this  tournament those who do know will forgive me for giving a 1
short  and  allow  ander  triwizard  tournament was first established some seven 1
competition between the three largest european schools of achampion was selected 1
to  represent  each  and the three peted in three magical the schools took it in 1
turns  to the and it was generally agreed to be a most excellent way witches and 1
wizards of different nationalities that the so the tournament was hermione looking 2
but  her  anxiety did not seem to be by the majority of students in the many of 1
them  and harry himself was far more interested in hearing about in about deaths 1
that had happened hundreds of years have been several attempts over the centuries 2
to  reinstate  of  which  has  been  very  our  own departments of tional magical 1
cooperation and magical games and sports have decided another we have worked hard 2
over  the  summer  to  ensure  that  will  find  himself  or herself in heads of 1
beauxbatons  and  durmstrang  will  be arriving with in and the selection of the 1
three champions will take at judge will decide which students are most worthy to compete 1
heir  and  a thousand galleons personal prize going for fred weasley hissed down 1
the his face lit with prospect of such glory and he was not the only self as the 1
hogwarts at every house harry could see people at or else whispering fervently to 2
their but then dumbledore and the hall quieted once though i know all of you will 1
be  to bring the triwizard heads of the participating along with the ministry of 1
age  restriction  on contenders this only students years or older be allowed to 1
put  forward  their names for dumbledore raised his voice for several people had 1

students below sixth and year with i will personally be ensuring that no underage 2
student  into  making them his light blue eyes twinkled as they over and mutinous 1
therefore beg you not to waste your time self if you are.

greater  part of this i know that eign guests while they are with and will give 1
your  champion  when  he  or she is and it is and i know how all to be alert and 1
rested as you enter your lessons tomorrow dumbledore sat down again and turned to 2
talk to there was a and banging as all the students got to their feet and the rance 1

the  fourth year snape had disliked all of and shown it he seemed strangely wary 1
of  displaying  overt  whenever  harry  saw the two of them together or when in 1
orridors  had  the  distinct  impression  that snape was avoiding r reckon a bit 1
scared  of  you  harry  said  if  moody turned snape into a horned said his eyes 1

fter a moment moody smiled first time harry had seen do his heavily scarred face 1
look  more  twisted  and  contorted  than  to  know that he ever did anything as 1
friendly  as be arthur moody father got me out of a very tight corner a few days 1
staying  just  the  one  special favor to one and then back to my quiet he gave a 1

the  including  and  moody though his magical eye was still fixed on said ron dad 1
told me about is it called the imperius.

or  said  moody father would know that gave the ministry a lot of trouble at one 1
the  moody  got  heavily  to  his  mismatched opened his desk three large black 1
spiders were scuttling around inside him hated moody reached into the caught one 1
of  the and held it in the palm that they could all see he then pointed his wand 1
at it the spider leapt from hand on a fine thread of silk and forward as though on 2
a it stretched out its legs then thread and landing on the where it began to cartwheel 1
nd  the spider rose onto two of its hind legs and went everyone was laughing do 1
he  like would if i did it to the laughter died away almost said moody quietly as 1
the spider balled itself up and could make it jump out of the drown throw itself 2
down  ron  gave  an  involuntary  there  were a lot of witches and wizards being 1
controlled by the said and harry knew he was talking about the days in had job for 2
the  trying  to  sort  out  who  was being forced to and was acting of their own 1
imperius curse can be and be teaching you but it takes and not got better avoid 1
being hit with it if.

you  he and moody picked up the somersaulting spider and threw it back else know 1
another  illegal hand flew into the air again and to slight did the only class in 1
which  neville  usually volunteered information best neville looked surprised at 1
his own said his magical eye rolling right over to fix one cruciatus said neville 2
in a small but distinct moody was looking very intently at this time with he his 1
magical eye swooping down to check the.

register  neville  nodded but moody made no further turning back to the class he 1
reached into the jar for the next spider and placed it upon apparently too scared 2
cruciatus  said  to  be a bit bigger for you to get the pointing his wand at the 1
spider it was now larger than a abandoning all his chair as far away from desk as 1
oody raised his wand pointed it at the and at the legs bent in upon its it rolled 2
over  and  began rocking from side to no sound came from but harry it would have 1
been moody did not remove his and the shudder and jerk more violently hermione said 1
arry looked around at she was not at the but at and following her saw that hands 1
were  clenched  upon  the desk in of knuckles his eyes wide moody raised his the 1
legs  but it continued moody and the spider shrank back to its proper he put he 1
aid moody need thumbscrews or knives to torture someone can perform the cruciatus 2
that  one was very popular once anyone know any harry looked from the looks on he 1
guessed they were all what was going to happen to the last hand shook slightly for 1
he raised it into the said looking hermione several people looked uneasily around 1
at including said another slight smile twisting his lopsided the last avada the killing 1
e put his hand into the glass and almost as though it spider scuttled frantically 2
around  the  bottom  of  the trying trapped and placed it upon the it started to 1
scuttle.

across moody raised his and harry felt a sudden thrill of oody there was a flash 1
of blinding green light and a rushing as a something was soaring through the air 1
the  spider rolled over but unmistakably several of the students stifled ron had 1
ackward and almost toppled off his seat as the.

spider moody swept the dead spider off the desk onto the he said and no no blocking 1
nly  one known person has ever survived and sitting right in harry felt his face 1
redden  as  eyes of looked into his he everyone else looking around at him harry 1
stared  at  the blank fascinated by but not really seeing it so that was how his 1
parents  had  exactly  like that and unmarked had they simply seen the flash of 1
green  light and of before life was wiped from their harry had been picturing his 1
deaths over and over since found out they had been ever since found out what had 1
ormtail  had  betrayed his whereabouts to who had come to at their how voldemort 1

ily  told  her  to  move  aside so that he could kill how to her refused to stop 1
shielding  her  and so voldemort had turning his wand on harry knew these details 1
because  he  had  heard  his voices he dementors last year that was the terrible 1
power  of the de to relive the worst memories of their and in their own moody was 1
speaking  from a great it seemed to with a massive he pulled himself back to the 1
present and listened to acurse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it wands 1
out now and point them at me and say the and i but that not here to teach you how 2
to  do  if  no why am i showing because got got to appreciate what the worst you 1
want  to  find  yourself  in  facing constant he and the whole class those three 1
curses  and  cruciatus  known  as  unforgivable the use of any one of them on a 1
fellow  life  sentence in what up what got to teach you to you need you need but 1
most  of  you  need to ceasing get out your copy this they spent the rest of the 1
lesson taking notes on each of spoke until the bell rang when moody had dismissed 2
a torrent of talk burst most people were discussing the see it when he killed it 2
like they were talking about the harry as though it had been some spectacular but 1
he  found  it  very  entertaining  it had she said tensely to harry and the ruddy 1
library said said hermione pointing up a side neville was standing halfway up the 1
staring  at  the  stone  wall  opposite him with look he had worn when moody had 1
demonstrated  the  cruciatus hermione said neville looked he his voice much higher 1
than i for are you all said neville gabbled in the same unnaturally high.

interesting dinner mean lesson for ron gave harry a.

startled but an odd clunking noise sounded behind and they turned limping toward 2
all  four of them fell watching him but it was in a much lower and gentler growl 1
than  they  had  yet  all  he said to you come up to my come we can have a cup of 1
eville  looked  even  more  frightened  at the prospect of tea moody turned his 1
magical eye upon all are said almost blue eye quivered slightly in its socket as it 2
surveyed  got  to  it  seems  but  got to no point come got some books that might 1
neville  looked  pleadingly  at and but they say so neville had no choice but to 1
allow himself to be steered is was that said watching neville and moody turn the 1
aid  looking  said  ron to harry as they set off for the great and george were he 1
really knows his when he avada the way that spider just just snuffed it right but 2
ron  fell suddenly silent at the look on face and reached the great when he said 1
he  supposed they had better a predictions since they would take hermione did not 1
join in with harry and conversation and then left for the library harry and ron 1
walked back who had been thinking of nothing else all through now unforgivable curses 1
oody  and  dumbledore  be  in  trouble  with the ministry if harry asked as they 1
approached  the fat said always done things his and been getting in trouble for i 1
attacks  first and asks later hthe fat lady swung forward to reveal the entrance 1
and they common which was crowded and we get our divination said on they went up to 2
the  dormitory  to fetch their books and to sitting on his he looked a good deal 1
calmer than at the though still not entirely his eyes were rather all harry asked 1
aid  just  reading  this  book professor moody lent he held up the magical water 1
plants  of the professor sprout told professor moody really good at neville there 1
was a faint note of pride in his voice that had thought like telling neville what 1
professor  sprout  had harry had cheering neville for neville very rarely heard 1
that he was.

wondered  whether  it had anything to do with entering the as harry george shook 1

downstairs was now sitting smugly beside the fat ture lining seven staircases to 2
reach here before both she down at him with the keenest said the fat just told me 1
just  been  chosen as school said harry most certainly said the pale witch the said 1

blast of noise that met ears when the portrait opened almost next thing he he was 2
being  wrenched  inside  the  common  room pairs of and was facing the whole of 1
gryffindor all of nd told us bellowed he looked half half.

one single person seemed to have noticed to lee jordan had unearthed a gryffindor 2
banner from and he draping it around harry like a harry get whenever he tried to 1
he staircase up to the the crowd around him closed forcing on stuffing crisps and 2
peanuts  into his everyone wanted to how how he had tricked age line and managed 1
to get he over and over know how but for all the notice anyone he might just as 1
well  he bellowed after nearly half an george to he wanted more than anything to 1
find  ron and to find a of them seemed to be in the common insisting that he the 1
little creevey brothers as they attempted to waylay naged to shake everyone off 1
and  climb up to the dormitory as to his great he found ron was lying on his bed 1
in the fully he looked up when harry slammed the door you harry aid he was but it 1
was  a  very  strained  sort  of  harry  that  he was still wearing the scarlet 1
gryffindor  banner  that  to  take it but it was knotted very ron lay on the bed 1
truggle to remove he when harry had finally removed the banner and thrown.

and no one seen not you doing a really good impression of harry said and there was 2
no trace of a forced or on his want to get to i expect need to be up early.

tomorrow he wrenched the hangings shut around his leaving harry standing staring 1
at  the dark red velvet now hiding one of the would chapter eighteen the weighing 1
of the wands when harry woke up on sunday it took him a moment to he miserable and 2
then  the  memory  of  the  previous  night ripped back the curtains of his own 1
intending  to  talk to to him to find that bed was he had obviously gone down to 1
arry  dressed  and  went  down the spiral staircase into the the people who had 1
already finished breakfast broke into going down into the great hall and facing 1
the  rest of sort of was not it was or stay here and allow to by the creevey who 1
were  both  beckoning frantically to him solutely over to the portrait pushed it 1
climbed out of ith she holding up a stack of which she was carrying in a you want 1
to go for a said harry they went crossed the entrance hall quickly without looking 1
nd were soon striding across the lawn toward the where reflected blackly in the 1
it was a chilly and they as harry told hermione exactly what had happened after 1
night  to  his immense hermione accepted his story of course i knew you entered 1
she said when finished about the scene in the chamber off the look on your face 1
our  but the question who did put it because i think any student could have done 1
never be able to fool the.

hat supposed to it hermione said harry said of he wants to make a prat of himself in 1
ront of the whole does said hermione always you who gets all the you know it know 1

brothers  to  compete  against and his best and really famous always shunted to 1
people  see and he puts up with and he never mentions i time said harry tell him 1
from  me  swap  any  time  he  tell  him from me welcome to people gawping at my 1
forehead.

i  not teiling him hermione said him the only way to sort this not running around 1
after  him  trying to make him grow several owls in a nearby tree took flight in 1
believe not once got my neck broken or not said hermione not funny at she looked extremely 1
een thinking know what got to straight the moment we get back to give ron a good 1
kick up the to got to tell him he asked you to keep him posted on everything going 2
on  at  almost  as if he expected like i brought some parchment and a quill out 1
with  off said looking around to check that they be but grounds were quite came 1

ant you to tell said hermione going to find.

the  daily about you already in half the books about you and sirius would rather 1
hear  it  from i know he write to said throwing his last piece of toast into the 1
oth stood and watched it floating there for a before ter and scooped it beneath 1
the  then they returned to owl am i going to harry said as they climbed the told 1
ron  if  you can borrow not asking ron for harry borrow one of the school anyone 1
can  use  said  they  went up to the hermione gave harry a piece of a and of then 1
strolled  around the long lines of looking at all ry sat down against a wall and 1
wrote  his  ear you told me to keep you posted on happening at so here if but the 1
triwizard  happening  this  year and on saturday picked as a fourth i who put my 1
name in the goblet other hogwarts champion is cedric from hufflepuff he paused at 2
this  he  had  an  urge  to  say something about the anxiety that seemed to have 1
settled inside his chest since translate this into so he simply dipped his quill back 1
ope and he told getting to his feet and brushing straw off his hedwig fluttered 1
down onto his shoulder and held out use harry told looking around for the school 2
got to.

use hedwig gave a very loud hoot and took off so suddenly.

that she kept her back to harry all the time he was tying his to the barn owl had 2
flown  harry  reached out to stroke but ly and soared up into the rafters out of 1
hen  harry said my if harry had thought that matters would improve once everyone 1
ing  the  following day showed him how mistaken he he rest of the school once he 1
was  back  at lessons it was that like the thought harry had entered himself for 1
the  unlike  they  did  not seem the who were usually on excellent terms with the 1
markably  cold  toward  the  whole lot of one herbology to it was plain that the 1
hufflepuffs  felt  that harry had by the fact that hufflepuff house very rarely 1
got any and was one of the few who had ever given them having ernie macmillan and 2
justin with whom harry normally got talk to him even though they were repotting 1
bouncing  bulbs  laugh  rather  unpleasantly  when one of the bouncing bulbs and 1
macked  him  hard  in  the  ron talking to harry hermione making very forced but 1
though  both  answered her they avoided eye contact with each harry thought even 1
professor sprout him she was head of hufflepuff he would have been looking forward 2
to seeing hagrid under of magical creatures meant seeing the slytherins too first 1
ith them since becoming malfoy arrived at cabin with his familiar sneer firmly in 1
he  he  said  to  crabbe  and goyle the moment he got earshot of your autograph 1
better  get  a  signature  because  i going to be around much half the triwizard 1
champions  have  how reckon going to ten minutes into the first crabbe and goyle 1
guffawed but malfoy had to stop emerged from the back of his cabin balancing a tower 1
arge  to  the  hagrid  proceeded to explain that the reason the skrewts had been 1
killing one another was an excess of and would be for each student to fix a leash 2
on  a skrewt thing about this plan was that it distracted malfoy this thing for a 1
he repeated in staring into one of exactly are we supposed to fix the around the 2
the blasting the said might want ter put on hide as an extra harry come here help 2
me with.

this real was totalk to harry away from the rest of the until everyone else had 1
set  off with their then turned to in the of the harry corrected eyes looked very 1
anxious  under his wild idea who put yeh in fer believe i do said concealing with 1
difficulty the rush of he felt i hagrid say it i believe yeh dumbledore.

lieves i knew who did do said the pair of them looked out over the the class was and 1
he  skrewts  were  now over three feet and extremely no longer less and they had 1
developed a kind of shiny they looked cross between giant scorpions and elongated 2
crabs  still  they  had  become immensely strong and very hard like hagrid said 1
harry assumed he was talking about the because his classmates certainly every now 2
and  with  one of the ends would causing it to shoot forward than one person was 1
being dragged along on their trying.

to  i  hagrid  sighed  looking back down at him with a worried expression on his 1
seems ter happen ter harry everything did seem to happen to that was more hermione 2
had said as they had walked around the and was that ron was no longer talking to 1
he  next few days were some of worst at the closest he had feeling like this had 1
been during those in his second when a had suspected him of attacking his fellow 1
but  ron  had thought he could have coped with the rest of the behavior back as a 1
but  he going to try and persuade ron to talk it was lonely with dislike pouring 1
in  on  him from he could understand the even if he like they had champion to he 1
expected nothing less than vicious insults highly unpopular there and always had 1
because he had helped beat both at quidditch and in the but he had hoped the ravenclaws 1
ight have found it in their hearts to support him as much most ravenclaws seemed 1
to think that he had been desperate to tricking the goblet into accepting his then 2
there  was  the  fact  that  cedric  looked  the part of exceptionally with his 1
straight dark and gray it was hard was receiving more admiration these cedric or 1
viktor harry girls who had been so keen to get autograph begging school bags one 1
eanwhile there was no reply from hedwig was refusing to professor trelawney was 1
predicting  his  death with even he badly at summoning charms in professor class 1
that he was given the only person to get apart from really not that hermione tried 2
to  reassure him as they left class had been making objects zoom across the room 1
to her some sort of weird magnet for board wastepaper and just concentrating properly 1
hy  that  said harry darkly as cedric diggory walked by large group of simpering 1
all of whom looked at harry double potions to look forward to this double potions 2
was always a horrible but these days it was being shut in a dungeon for an hour 1
and a half with seemed determined to punish harry as much as possible for daring 1
as about the most unpleasant thing harry could he had.

one with hermione sitting next to him intoning ignore ignore under her and he see 2
why today should be any when he and hermione arrived at dungeon after they found the 1
ng  each  and every one of them wearing a large badge for one wild moment harry 1
thought they were badges he the same in luminous red letters that burnt brightly 1
in.

the support the real hogwarts said malfoy loudly as harry this all they.

do he pressed his badge into his and the message upon it to be another which glowed otter 1
he slytherins howled with each of them pressed their badges the potter stinks was 2
shining brightly all around he felt the.

in very hermione said sarcastically to pansy parkinson and her who were laughing 1
harder ron was standing against the wall with dean and he but he sticking up for harry 1
aid  holding  out  a  badge  to got but touch my just washed you want a mudblood 1
sliming  it  some  of  the  anger  harry had been feeling for days and his he had 1
reached  for  his  wand before thought what he them scrambled out of the backing 1
down hermione said malfoy said drawing out his own not here to look after you now 1
if got the guts for a split they looked into each at exactly the same.

both  harry creamed jets of light shot from both hit each other in and off at hit 1
goyle in the and hit goyle bellowed and put his hands where great ugly boils were 2
springing up whimpering in was.

her ron had hurried forward to see what was wrong with harry hand away from her it 2
a pretty front larger than average now growing at an alarming she was abeaver as 1
her  teeth  past  her bottom toward her chin them and let out a what is all this 1
noise said a deadly snape had the slytherins clamored to give their snape yellow 1
finger at malfoy.

and  attacked  attacked  each other at the same harry he hit snape examined whose 1
face  now  resembled  something that would in a book on poisonous snape got ron he 1
forced  hermione to show snape her teeth was doing her though this was difficult 1
as  they  had  now grown down and the other slytherin girls were doubled up with 1
silent  at hsnape looked coldly at then see no hermione let out a her eyes filled 1
with  she turned on her the way up the corridor and out of it was that both harry 1
and  ron  started  shouting at snape at lucky their voices echoed so much in the 1
stone  for in the for him to hear exactly what they were calling he got the he in 1
his  silkiest  points from gryffindor and a detention potter and now get or be a 1
worth  of  ears were the injustice of it made him want to curse a slimy he passed 1
walked with ron to the back of the bag down onto the ron was shaking with anger 1
too  a  it  thing  was back to normal between but then ron turned and mus leaving 1
harry alone at his on the other side of the back on snape and pressed his potter 1
stinks flashed once.

more  harry  sat there staring at snape as the lesson if only he knew how to do 1
the  cruciatus  have  snape flat jerking and said looking around at them his cold 1
black eyes glittering should all have prepared your recipes i want you to brew we 1
will be selecting someone on whom to test eyes met and harry knew what was snape 1
was going to poison harry imagined picking up his and sprinting to the front down 1
on greasy head then a knock on the dungeon door.

burst  it  was  colin  he edged into the beaming at and walked up to desk at the 1
front of the said snape supposed to take harry potter snape stared down his hooked 1
hose smile faded from his eager has another hour of potions to said snape will come 1
hen this class is colin bagman wants he said the champions have got to think they 2
want  to  take  harry would have given anything he owned to have stopped colin he 1
chanced  half a glance at but ron was staring determinedly very snape leave your 1
things i want you back down here later to test.

your  sir  got to take his things with squeaked the said your bag and get out of 1
harry  swung  his  bag  over his got and headed for the slytherin potter stinks 1
flashed  at  him  from  said  starting to speak the moment harry had closed the 1
ungeon door behind you being really said harry heavily as they set off toward the 2
steps  into do they want photos daily i said harry what i said colin when they had 1
reached the right harry.

knocked  he  was  in  a fairly small most of the desks had been pushed leaving a 1
large  space  in  the  three  of  had been placed in front of the blackboard and 1
covered  with  a  long length of five the and ludo bagman was sitting in one of 1
talking  to  a  had  never  seen who was wearing magenta viktor krum was standing 1
moodily  in a corner as usual and fheur were in fheur looked a good deal happier 1
than harry had kept throwing back her head so that her long silvery a ing a large 2
black camera that was smoking was watching.

fleur  bagman suddenly spotted got up and here he champion number in you in you 1
nothing to worry just the wand weighing the rest of the judges will be a harry repeated 1
ave  to check that your wands are fully no you your most important tools in the 1
tasks  said  upstairs  now  and  then  going  to  be a little photo this is rita 1
gesturing toward the witch in magenta doing a small piece aily not that said rita 2
her eyes on her hair was set in elaborate and curiously rigid curls that jawed she 2
wore  jeweled  the thick fingers clutching her ended in wonder if i could have a 1
little word with harry still gazing fixedly at youngest you to add a bit of cried 2
is  harry  has no aid said rita and in a her fingers had upper in a surprisingly 1
strong  and  she was steering him out of y want to be in there with all that she 1
this is nice.

y upon an upturned pushing harry down onto a cardboard throwing them into see she 1
unsnapped  her  skin  handbag and pulled out a handful of she with a wave of her 1
wand and magicked into so that.

they if i use a it leaves me free to talk to.

you  said  rita  smile harry counted three gold she reached again codile bag and 1
drew  out a long quill and a roll of between them on a crate of magical mess she 1
put  the  tip of the green quill into her sucked it for a moment on the where it 1
stood  balanced on its quivering my name is rita daily harry hooked down quickly 1
at  the  the  moment  rita  skeeter had started to skidding across the attractive 1
blonde rita savage quill has punctured many inflated eputations said rita yet and 2
she  ripped  the  top piece of it and stuffed it into her now she leaned toward 1
harry and made you decide to enter the triwizard said harry but he was distracted 1
by  the  even  though he was dashing across the and in its wake he could make an 1
ugly  souvenier  of  a  tragic disfigures the otherwise whose eyes the said rita 1
skeeter reluctantly harry looked up at did you decide to enter the said know how 1
my name got into the goblet of i put.

it  rita skeeter raised one heavily no need to be scared of getting into we all 1
know really have entered at but worry about our readers hove a iharry know do you 2
feel  about the tasks said really i said his insides squirmed fortably as he have 1
died in the said rita skeeter you thought about that at they say going to be a lot 2
safer this said the quill whizzed across the parchment between back and as.

it looked death in the face said rita watching him would you say affected said yet 1
ou  think that the trauma in your past might have made you to live up to your do 1
you  think  that  perhaps  you  were  tempted to nament said starting to feel you 1
remember  your  parents at said rita talking said do you think feel if they knew 1
you were competing in.

the  harry  was  feeling really annoyed how on earth was he feel if they were he 1
could feel rita skeeter watching him he avoided her gaze and hooked down at words 2
the quill had tears fill those startlingly green eyes as our.

conversation have not got tears in my said harry before rita skeeter could say a 1
the  door  of the broom was looked blinking in the bright albus dumbledore stood 1
looking at of squashed into the cried rita with every appearance of delight harry 1
noticed  her  quill and the parchment had suddenly vanished from clawed fingers 1
were  hastily snapping shut the clasp of she standing up and holding out one of 1
her mannish hands to hope you saw my piece over the summer about the.

of said his eyes particularly enjoyed scription of me as an obsolete rita skeeter 2
look  remotely  was  just making the point that some of your ideas are a and that 1
many wizards in the will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the said with 1
ourteous  bow and a afraid we will have to discuss the of the wands is about to 1
and it cannot take place broom very glad to get away from rita harry hurried back 2
into the pions were now sitting in chairs near the and he sat down next up at the 1
where  four  of  the  five  judges were now sitting madame and ludo rita skeeter 1
settled herself down in a harry saw her slip the parchment out of her bag spread 1
of  the  and  place  it once more on the iintroduce said taking his place at the 1
table  and  talking  to the will be checking your wands to ensure are tion before 1
harry hooked and with a jolt of surprise saw an old ing quietly by the harry had 1
met ollivander before was the whom harry had bought his own wand over three years 2
ago  could  we have you said stepping the empty space in the middle of the fleur 1
delacour  swept over to olhivander and handed he he twirled the wand between his 1
long fingers like a baton it gold then he held it chose to his eyes and examined it 1
e said and a half and.

dear  from  ze of a said of my so fleur was part thought making a mental note to 1
tell then bered that ron speaking.

to said never used veela hair of i find it for rather temperamental to each his 1
and  if this suits ollivander ran his fingers along the apparently then he and a 1
bunch  of  flowers burst from the very in fine working said scooping up the and 1
handing them to fleur with her fleur glided back to her smiling at cedric as he passed 1
his  is  one  of  said  with  much  more as cedric handed over his i remember it 1
containing  a  single the particularly fine male must have been seventeen nearly 1
gored me after i plucked his twelve and a quarter pleasantly in fine you treat it 1
t last said harry hooked down at his own he could see finger marks all ful of robe 2
from his knee and tried to rub it clean the end of fleur delacour gave him a very 2
patronizing  and  ollivander sent a stream of silver smoke rings across the the 1
ronounced himself and then if viktor krum got up and and toward he thrust out his 2
wand and stood with his hands in the of said is a gregorovitch unless much a fine 1
though the styling is never quite he lifted the wand and examined it turning it over 1
ornbeam and dragon he shot at who thicker one usually quite ten and a quarter the 2
hornbeam wand let off a blast hike a and a number of birds of the end and through 2
the  open window into the watery said handing krum back his harry got to his feet 1
and walked past krum to he handed over said his pale eyes suddenly how well iharry 2
could remember he could remember it as though it four summers on his eleventh he 1
had  entered shop with hagrid to buy a ollivander had taken his measurements and 1
then to harry had waved what felt like every wand in the until at he that suited 1
him  which  was  made  of eleven inches and contained feather from the tail of a 1
ollivander had been very so compatible with this he had and not until harry asked 2
what curious had olhivander explained that the phoenix feather the same bird that 2
had  supplied  the core of lord harry had never shared this piece of information 1
with he was and as far as he was concerned its relation to wand rather as he help 1
being related to aunt he really hoped vander about to tell the room about he had 1
a  funny  quill  might  just explode with excitement if he ollivander spent much 1
longer  examining  wand  than anyone he made a fountain of wine shoot out of and 1
handed  it  it  was  still in perfect you said standing up at the may go back to 1
lessons now perhaps it would be quicker just to go.

down feeling that at last something had gone right harry black camera jumped up 1
and cleared cried bagman the judges and what do you do those said rita whose eyes 1
were  upon  harry then perhaps some individual the photographs took a long madame 1
maxime cast everyone else she and the photographer stand far enough back to get her 1
ventually  she had to sit while everyone else stood around around his finger to 1
give it an extra whom harry would been used to this sort of at the back of the the 1

first task was drawing steadily he ahead of him hike some horrific barring his he 2
had  never  they  were  way beyond anything he had experienced before a last one 1
against which had decided who would win the.

harry  finding it hard to think about the future at he felt and would finish the 1
he  see  how  sirius was going to make him feel any better to perform an unknown 1
piece  of difficult and dangerous magic the mere sight of a friendly face would 1
be something at the saying that he would be beside the common room fire at the and 2
hermione spent a long time going over plans for forcing any room on the night in 1
if the worst came to the they but they hoped they have to resort to that would skin 1
n  the  life  became  even  worse  for  harry within the confines of skeeter had 1
published her piece about the triwizard and it so much a report on the tournament 2
as a highly colored life page had been given over to a picture of the article had 2
been all about the names of the beauxbatons and champions had been squashed into 1
the last line of the and the article had appeared ten days and harry still got a 2
of  his  stomach  every time he thought about rita skeeter had him things that he 1
remember ever saying in his let alone i suppose i get my strength from my i know 2
be see me sometimes at night i still cry about not to nothing will hurt me during 2
the because watching but rita skeeter had gone even further than transforming his 1
he  had  interviewed  other people about him harry has at last found love at his 1
close colin says rarely seen out of the company of one hermione a like is one of 2
the  top students in the from the moment the article had harry had had to endure 1
ainly it at him as he passed and making sneering ain case you start crying in when 2
have you been one of the top students in the or a you and longbottom have set.

up harry found himself shouting as he wheeled around in the having had just about 2
just  been  crying  my  eyes out over off to do a bit was just dropped your it was 1
harry  felt  the  color rising in his he taking the quill good luck on she really 1
hope  you do which left harry feeling extremely hermione had come in for her fair 1
share  of unpleasantness yelling at innocent in harry was full of admiration for 1
pansy parkinson had shrieked the first time she had come face with hermione after 2
article had was she judging.

against  hermione said in a dignified holding her head in the air and sniggering 1
slytherin  girls as though she hear ignore but harry ignore ron spoken to him at 1
all since he harry had half hoped they would make things up during the were forced 2
to  pickle brains in but that had been the which seemed to have confirmed belief 1
that harry was.

all  hermione  was  furious  with the pair of she went them to talk to each but 1
harry was he would talk to admitted that harry put his name in the goblet of fire 2
and start harry said his miss hermione said i know he misses you said miss but this 2
was  a downright harry liked hermione very but she there was much hess laughter 1
and a lot more hanging in was your best harry still mastered summoning he seemed to 1
eveloped  something  of  a  block  about  and  hermione insisted that would they 1
consequently spent a lot of time poring over books viktor krum was in the library 2
an  awful  lot  and  he  he or was he looking for things to help him through the 1
omplained about krum being there that he ever bothered them giggling girls often 1
turned  up to spy on him from behind oise not even she muttered glaring at sharp 1
nly  like  him because they look twice at him if he do that wonkyfaint thing said 1
through gritted quite apart from liking to get terms it caused him another pang 1
to  imagine  expression if he hermione talking about it is a strange but when you 1
are dreading and would give down it has a disobliging habit of speeding the days until 1
y  as though someone had fixed the clocks to work at double controlled panic was 1
with him wherever he as everpresent as the daily on the saturday before the first 2
all students in the third visit the village of hermione told harry that it would 1
he  castle  for  a and harry need much about he you want to go with hermione went 1
slightly  thought we might meet up with three said harry this is so stupid but not 1
meeting  and wearing my invisibility all right hermione i hate talking to you in 1
that i never if looking at you so harry put on his invisibility cloak in the went 2
back and and hermione set off.

for harry felt wonderfully free under the he watched other past they entered the 1
most  of  them sporting support cedric but remarks came his way for a and nobody 1
was  quoting  that  keep  looking  at me said hermione grumpily as they came out 1
sweetshop  eating  large think talking to move your lips so much please just take 1
off  your  cloak for a no going to bother said rita skeeter and her photographer 1
friend  had  just  emerged  talking in low they passed right by hermione without 1
hooking at the wall of honeydukes to stop rita skeeter from hitting him when they 1
were  harry  staying  in  the  i bet coming to watch irst as he said his stomach 1
flooded  with  a  wave of molten he he hermione discussed what was coming in the 1
first task he had want to think about said looking right through harry toward the 1
end of the we go and have a butterbeer in the three a bit you have to talk to she 1
added correctly interpreting the three broomsticks was mainly with hogwarts students 1
ut also with a variety of magical people harry rarely supposed that as hogsmeade 1
was the only wizard village a creatures like who were not as adept as wizards at 1
it  was  very hard to move through crowds in the in case trod on which tended to 1
lead  to awkward harry edged a table in the corner while hermione went to buy on 1
spotted who was sitting with and lee resisting the to good hard poke in the back 1
of  the  he  finally  reached  the  table hermione joined him a moment later and 1
slipped him a butterbeer look like such an sitting here on my she i brought o and 1
she  pulled out a notebook in which she had been keeping harry saw his and names 1
at the top of the very short it ago that they had sat making up those predictions 2
and appointed them secretary and maybe i should try and get some of the villagers 2
in  hermione  said looking around the said he took a swig of butterbeer under his 1
when  are  you going to give up on this have decent wages and working she hissed 1
tarting to think time for more direct i wonder how.

you  ask  fred  and  said  hermione lapsed into thoughtful while harry drank his 1
people in the all of them looked cheerful and ernie were swapping chocolate frog 2
cards  at  a  nearby both badges on their right over by the door he saw cho and 1
avenclaw she wearing a cedric badge this cheered up.

harry what he have given to be one of these sitting around.

and  with  nothing to worry about but he imagined how it would name come out of 1
the  goblet  of he be wearing the for one ron would be sitting with the three of 1
them  would  be imagining what deadly dangerous task the school champions be have 1
been really hooking forward to watching them do whatever with everyone safe in a 1
seat  at  the back of the he wondered how the other champions were every time he 1
had been surrounded by admirers and looking nervous but harry delacour from time 1
to  time  in the she looked exactly as she and krum just sat in the poring harry 1
thought  of and the tense knot in his chest seemed to be speaking to him in just 1
over twelve for tonight was common room fire nothing went as everything else had done 1
the back of enormous shaggy head had mercifully emerged over the harry wondered 1
why he spotted him at as but standing up he saw that hagrid had been leaning talking 1
agrid had his usual enormous tankard in front of but hip madam the pretty seem to 2
think much of she looking askance at moody as she collected glasses from tables 1
t was an insult to her mulled but harry knew moody last defense against the dark 1
arts lesson that he preferred to all as it was so easy for dark wizards to poison 2
an as harry he saw hagrid and moody get up to he then that hagrid see his magical 1
eye  on  the corner where harry was he tapped hagrid in the small of the back to 1
uttered  something  to and then the pair of them made their pub toward harry and 1
aid hagrid said smiling moody limped around the table and bent harry thought he was 1
ntil harry stared at him in the large chunk missing from particularly obvious at 1
a few moody your eye can you it can see through invisibility moody said come in i 1
can  tell  hagrid  was beaming down at harry harry knew hagrid see obviously told 1
hagrid  he  was hagrid now bent down on the notebook as and said in a whisper so 1
low  that only hear tonight at midnight at me wear that straightening hagrid said 1
ter see moody followed does hagrid want me to meet him at harry very said looking 1
wonder  what  up i know whether you should she looked nervously around and might 1
make.

you  it  was  true  that  going down to at midnight would mean cutting very fine 1
hermione  suggested sending hedwig down to to tell go assuming she would consent 1
to take the of course.

thought  better just to be quick at whatever hagrid wanted him might hagrid had 1
never asked harry to visit him so late at half past eleven that who had pretended 2
to  go  up to invisibility cloak back over himself and crept back downstairs afew 1
people were still in the creevey brothers had managed support cedric badges and 1
were trying to bewitch them to harry so all they had managed to do was get the stuck 1
otter  harry crept past them to the portrait hole and waited a keeping an eye on 1
his  then  hermione opened the fat lady had he slipped past her with a whispered 1
and set off the grounds were very harry walked down the lawn toward in the inside 2
of  the  enormous  beauxbatons  carriage was also lit hear madame maxime talking 1
inside it as he knocked on front hagrid opening the door and looking said slipping 2
inside the cabin and pulling the cloak.

off  summat  ter  show said there was an air of enormous excitement about he was 1
wearing  a  resembled an oversized artichoke in his it looked as though he had of 1
axle  but he had certainly attempted to comb his hair broken teeth tangled in you 1
showing  harry  said wondering if the skrewts had laid hagrid had managed to buy 1
another giant dog off a in with keep keep yerself covered with that said take he i 2
stay got to be back up at the castle by but hagrid he was opening the cabin door 2
and striding harry hurried to follow and to his great that hagrid was.

the madame maxime opened she was wearing a silk shawl wrapped she smiled when she 2
saw said beaming at and holding out a hand to help her down gmadame maxime closed 2
the  door  behind  hagrid  offered her around the edge of the paddock containing 1
madame  giant  totally  running  to keep up with had hagrid wanted to show him he 1
could  see  her  any  old  time he she exactly hard to but it seemed that madame 1
maxime was in for the same she said is it you are taking enjoy said hagrid trust 1
go  anyone i showed not ter course said madame fluttering her long black and still 1
they harry getting more and more irritated as he in checking his watch every now 1
and  hagrid had some might make him miss if they get there he was going back to 1
the and leave hagrid to enjoy his moonlit.

stroll but then they had walked so far around the perimeter of the the lake were 1
out  of  sight  heard  men were shouting up then a arsplitting hagrid led madame 1
maxime  around  a  clump  of trees and alongside them a split he thought he was 1
seeing and men them then his mouth.

fell  four  fully  dragons were rearing onto their hind legs inside an enclosure 1
fenced with thick planks of roaring and snorting shooting into the dark sky from 1
their fanged fifty feet on outstretched there was a one with pointed snapping and 1
t the wizards on the a scaled green which was writhing and all its a red one with 2
an  odd  fringe  of fine gold its fire clouds into the and a gigantic black more 1
than which was nearest to at least thirty seven or eight to each were attempting 1
on the chains connected to heavy leather straps around and looked high above and 1
saw  the  eyes  of  the  black with a bulging with either fear or he tell it was 1
making  a  a  creeching back yelled a wizard near the straining on the chain can 1
shoot fire at a range of twenty you seen this.

horntail  it  said hagrid no yelled another on the count of harry saw each of the 1
dragon  keepers  pull out they shouted in and the stunning spells shot into the 1
ursting  in showers of stars on the scaly hides harry watched the dragon nearest 1
to  them  teeter on its stretched wide in a silent its nostrils were suddenly of 1
ery  it  several tons of dragon hit the ground with a thud that harry could have 1
sworn made the trees behind him the dragon keepers lowered their wands and walked 2
forward  which  was  the size of a small they hurried to iron which they forced 1
deep  into  the ground with their acloser hagrid asked madame maxime the pair of 1
them moved up to the and harry the wizard who had warned hagrid and harry realized 2
who it he coming over to should be okay now put them out with a sleeping draft on 2
the way thought it might be dark and the quiet like you they not happy at breeds 1
you  got  said  gazing at the closest the black with something chose to its eyes 1
were  still just harry could gleaming yellow beneath its wrinkled is a hungarian 1
said a common welsh green over the smaller one swedish that a chinese the charlie 1
looked madame maxime was strolling away around the gazing at the stunned know you 1
were bringing charlie champions supposed to know coming bound to tell.

her thought like ter see shrugged still at the romantic said shaking his said one 1
fer each the is they gotta.

do get past i said be on hand if it gets extinguishing spells at the they wanted 1
nesting i know but i tell envy the one who gets the vicious its back as dangerous 1
harlie pointed toward the and harry saw spikes protruding along it every five of 1
fellow  keepers  staggered up to the horntail at of huge eggs between them in a 1
they placed them at hagrid let out a moan of got them said charlie then he said he 1
was still gazing at the hope still fine after faced this said charlie looking out 2
over  dare  tell  mum  what  got to do for the first already having kittens about 1
charlie imitated his anxious could enter that much too i thought they were all i 1
thought going to be an age she was in floods after that cries about his oh bless 2
i  harry  had had trusting to the fact that hagrid miss with of four dragons and 1
madame  maxime  to occupy he turned silently back to he know whether he was glad 1
seen  what was coming or this the first shock was over maybe if seen the dragons 1
for on he would have passed out cold in front of the whole but he he was going to 1
be armed with his wand just felt a narrow strip of wood a and he had to get past 1
with  everyone  harry sped skirting the edge of the he had just under fifteen the 1
fireside  and  talk  to  and he wanting to talk to someone than he did right now 1
without  he  ran  into something very harry fell his glasses clutching the cloak 1
around a.

voice harry hastily checked that the cloak was covering him and hay very outline 1
of the wizard he had he recognized the it was said karkaroff very looking around 1
in the harry remained still and after a minute or karkaroff seemed sort of he was 2
looking around at waist as though crept back under the cover of the trees and dragons 1
ery  slowly  and  very harry got to his feet and set off without making too much 1
hurrying  through the darkness he had no doubt whatsoever what karkaroff was up 1
he  had  find  out  what the first task was going to he might maxime heading off 1
around  the  forest  together  were hardly a and now all karkaroff had to do was 1
follow the sound of would know what was in store for the by the looks of the only 1
champion who would be facing.

the harry reached the slipped in through the front and he was very out of but he 2
dare slow he had less than to get up to the he gasped at the fat who was snoozing 1
in her frame in ortrait you say she muttered without opening her and the forward 1
to  admit  harry climbed the common room was fact that it smelled quite hermione 1
had  not  needed  to set that he and sirius got harry pulled off the invisibility 1
cloak and threw himself an the room was in the flames were the only source of on a 1
upport cedric badges the creeveys had been trying to improve they now read potter 2
really harry looked back into the.

and  head  was sitting in the if harry seen diggory do exactly the it would have 1
scared  him  out  of  his  his  face breaking the first smile he had worn for he 1
scrambled out of his down ysirius looked different from memory of when they had said 1
ace  had  been  gaunt  and surrounded by a quantity of matted hair was short and 1
clean face was and he looked much the only photograph harry had of which had been 2
taken at the mind how are said for a harry tried to say he do before he could stop 1
e  was  talking more than talked in days how no one he entered the tournament of 1
his  own free how rita skeeter how he walk down a corridor without being sneered 1
at about not believing and now just shown me coming in the first and and a he finished 1
irius  looked  at eyes full of eyes that had not yet lost the given them haunted 1
look  he  had  let harry talk himself but now he we can deal but get to that in 1
minute  got  long  broken into a wizarding house to use the could be back at any 1
there  are things i need to warn you said feeling his spirits slip a further few 1
surely there be nothing worse than dragons said he was a death you know what death 2
eaters was he was in azkaban with but he got bet everything dumbledore wanted an 1
auror  at  hogwarts  this  year keep an eye put him into azkaban in the first got 1
harry said slowly brain seemed to be struggling to another piece of shocking did 2
they  release  did  a deal with the ministry of said sirius said seen the his and 1
then  he  named  he put a load of other people into in not very popular in i can 1
tell and since he got teaching the dark arts to every student who passes through 1
he durmstrang champion.

as said harry are you saying karkaroff put my name in the because if he a really 1
good  he  seemed furious about he fknow a good said he convinced the ministry of 1
magic  to  him  been keeping an eye on the daily and the rest of the said reading 1
between  the lines of that skeeter article last the night before he started at i 1
know she says it was said seeing harry about to i think i think someone tried stop 2
him from getting to i think someone knew their job would be with him and no going 2
to  look  into  it  too heard intruders too but that mean he still spot the real 1
moody  was  the  ministry  ever what are you said harry s trying to kill but sbeen 1
nearing  some  very strange he said death eaters seem bit more active than usual 1
they  showed  themselves at the someone set off the dark and then you hear about 1
that witch gone aid she disappeared in and definitely where voldemort was rumored 1
e and she would have known the triwizard tournament not very likely have walked 1
straight  into  is  i knew bertha said sirius was at hogwarts when i a few years 1
above  your dad and and she was an very but no at agood say be very easy to lure 1
into  a  so voldemort could have found out about the said that what you you think 1
karkaroff  might be here on said sirius just karkaroff strike me as the go back 1
to  voldemort  unless he knew voldemort was enough whoever put your name in that 1
goblet did it for a and i would be a very good way to attack you and make it hike 1
a  really  good  plan from where said harry just have to stand back and let the 1
dragons  do  said  speaking very quickly be tempted to try a stunning spell are 1
strong and out by a single you need about half a dozen wizards i i just you can 1
do  it said is and a simple all you just but harry held up a hand to silence his 1
heart  suddenly  as he could hear footsteps coming down the spiral staircase he 1
hissed  at  someone  harry scrambled to his hiding the fire someone saw face they 1
would raise an almighty uproar ministry would get in would be questioned about whereabouts 1
arry  heard  a tiny in the fire behind him and knew had bottom of the spiral who 1
had decided to go for a stroll at and stopped sirius from telling him how to get 1
past a it was dressed in his maroon paisley ron stopped dead.

the and looked were you talking that got to do with harry are you doing down here 2
at this f just wondered where you ron broke going back to thought come nosing did 1
harry he knew that ron had no idea what walked in knew he done it on but he care this 1
oment  he hated everything about right down to the several of beneath his pajama 1
bout  said  his  face reddening with realized you want to be let you get on with 1
practicing  for your next in harry seized one of the potter really stinks badges 1
off as hard as he across the it hit ron on the forehead you harry for you to wear 2
on you might even have a scar if what you he strode across the room toward the he 1
half  expected  ron  to have liked ron to throw a punch at but ron just stood in 1
aving stormed lay awake in bed fuming for a long time him come up to chapter the 1
first  task harry got up on sunday morning and dressed so inattentively realized 1
he was trying to pull his hat onto his foot of his his clothes on the right parts 2
of his he hurried off gryffindor table in the great where she was eating with to 1
harry waited until hermione had swallowed her last her out onto the he told her 1
all  about the and about while they took another long walk around the alarmed as 1
she was by warnings about hermione still thought dragons were the more pressing 1
ust try and keep you alive until tuesday she said then can worry about they walked 2
three  times  around the trying all the way to would subdue a nothing whatsoever 1
occurred  to  so  they harry pulled down every book he could find on and of work 1
searching through the by treating this is no this is for nutters like hagrid who 1
want to keep them are extremely difficult to owing to the ancient which none but 1
the  most powerful spells can but sirius a would do try some simple said throwing 1
aside men who love too he returned to the table with a pile of set them and began 1
ach  in  hermione whispering nonstop at his there are switching but the point of 1
switching unless you its fangs for or something that would make it less.

the  book not much is going to get through a say transfigure but that you really 1
got  a  i doubt even professor unless supposed to put the spell on maybe to give 1
yourself  simple  i  we  done any of those in i only know about been doing harry 1
through gritted you shut up for a i m trying.

to but all that when hermione fell was that brain filled with blank which seem to 2
allow  room  for  he  stared  hopelessly  index of basic hexes for the busy and 1
instant but had that would probably increase a horn just what he to give it an extra 1
ack  why  he  read on his stupid said hermione irritably as viktor krum slouched 1
cast a surly look over at the pair distant corner with a pile of go back to the common 1
e  here  in  a twittering and sure as they left the a gang of girls tiptoed past 1
earing  a  bulgaria  scarf tied around harry barely slept that when he awoke on 1
monday  he for the first time ever just running away from but as he the breakfast 1
and thought about what leaving the castle would he it was the only place he had 1
ever been he supposed he his parents but he the knowledge that he would rather be 2
here  and  facing  a drive with dudley was good to it made him feel slightly with 1
difficulty  throat working too and as he and hermione got cedric diggory leaving 1
the cedric still know about the the only champion who if in thinking that maxime 1
and  karkaroff  would  have told see you in the harry coming to his decision as 1
cedric  leaving  the  catch  you  be the about to ring catch you by the time harry 1
reached  the bottom of the marble cedric at with a load of harry want to talk to 1
cedric  in  front  among those who had been quoting rita article at him every he 1
ollowed cedric at a distance and saw that he was harry an pausing at a distance 1
from he pulled out his.

and  bag  and  books  spilled  out  of it onto the several of said cedric in an 1
exasperated voice as his friends bent flitwick go this was exactly what harry had 1
been hoping he slipped waited until friends had disappeared into their and hurried 1
hich was now empty of everyone but himself said picking up a copy of a guide to 1
advanced that was splattered with bag just and said first task.

is  said  looking said speaking in case professor flitwick came out to see cedric 1
had got got one for each of and got to get cedric stared at harry saw some of the 2
panic  been  flickering in gray you cedric said in a hushed said how did you find 1
not  supposed  to  said harry quickly knew hagrid would be in trouble if not the 1
only  one  who fleur and krum will know by karkaroff both saw the dragons cedric 1
straightened his arms full of inky and his ripped dangling off one he stared at 1
and  there  was a almost is are you telling he harry looked at him in he was sure 1
cedric  have asked the dragons harry have let his worst enemy face those perhaps 1
malfoy he said to all know on an.

even  cedric  was  still  hooking at him in a slightly suspicious clunking noise 1
behind he turned around and saw moody.

from  with he off you harry stared apprehensively at had he overheard supposed to 1
be in mind in my harry followed wondering what was going to happen to him to know 1
how found out about the would moody go to or just turn harry into a it might be 1
easier  to  get  past  harry  thought  be  much less easy to see from a height he 1
followed  moody into his moody closed the door his magical eye fixed upon him as 1
well as the normal was a very decent thing you just moody said harry know what to 1
this the reaction he had said and harry he had visited this office under two of 1
its previous in walls had been plastered with winking pictures of professor lupin 1

for them to study in of number of exceptionally odd objects that harry supposed had 1
ad been an on his desk stood what looked hike a glass spinning harry it once as a 1
because  he  owned one though it was much smaller in the corner on a small table 1
stood an object that an golden television it was humming what appeared to be a hung 1

keyholes in a harry wondered what was in until next sharply back found out about 2
the harry been afraid of this he told and he certainly going to tell that hagrid 1
had  broken  the  all  said  sitting  down  and  stretching out his wooden leg a 1
traditional  part  of the triwizard tournament and always said harry was sort of 1
accident  that i found moody accusing been telling dumbledore from the can be as 1
as he but you can bet old karkaroff and have told their champions everything they 2
they want to they like to prove only moody gave another harsh and his magical eye 1
swiveled so feel queasy to watch got any ideas how going to get past your dragon said aid 1
ot  going  to  tell  said moody show just going to give you some general and the 1
first  bit is to got said before he could stop growled got strengths if i say got 1

fat lot of said staring at him very his magical eye barely a damn good flier from 2
what harry stared at not allowed a only got my second piece of general said moody 1
interrupting  to  use  simple  spell  that will enable you to get what you harry 1
looked at him what did he whispered them not that and it he was best at he needed 1
to  pass the dragon in he needed his and for his he needed harry when he had sped 1
into  greenhouse three minutes ahurried apology to professor sprout as he passed 1
need  to  think been trying to she whispered her eyes round with anxiety over the 1
top of the quivering flutterby bush she was ineed to learn how to do a summoning 1
charm  properly  by and so they they have but headed for a free where harry tried 1
with all his might to make various objects fly across having the books and quills 2
kept losing heart halfway.

a  moment as though he was going to he certainly the first time in but harry was 1
still feeling too toward rest of the lesson trying to attract small objects toward 1
anaged to make a fly zoom straight into his though he prowess at summoning charms 2
the fly was just he forced down some dinner after then returned to the empty using 2
the invisibility cloak to avoid the they kept they would have stayed but peeves 1

his blind panic had heft it returned in full on the atmosphere in the school was 1
one  of  great  tension  and  giving  all  the  students time to get down to the 1
enclosure  of  they  yet  know  what  they  would harry felt oddly separate from 1
everyone  around whether they luck or hissing have a box of tissues as he it was 1
ervousness so advanced that he wondered whether he just lose his to lead him out 1
to his and start trying to curse in a more peculiar fashion than rushing past in 1

then  started  pacing around the tent he looked reacted at perhaps they thought 1
they might be sick if was certainly how harry but at had volunteered for and in no 2
time  at hundreds upon hundreds of pairs of feet their owners talking harry felt 1
as  separate  from  the crowd they were a different and then seemed like about a 1
second to was opening the neck of the purple silk he offering it to fleur she put a 2
shaking  hand  inside the bag and drew out a of it had the number two around its 1
neck and harry by the sign of but rather a determined that he had been madame told 2
her  what was the same held true for he pulled out the scarlet chinese around its 1
he even just sat back down and stared at the cedric put his hand into the and out 2
came the swedish.

hungarian  and  the  number it stretched its at and bared its minuscule there you 1
said  have each pulled out the dragon you will the numbers refer to the order in 1
which you are to take going to have to leave you in a because just go out into the 2
enclosure when you hear a all could uick said harry and he got up and went out of 2
the tent who walked him a short distance into the and then turned to a expression 1
on  his  all  anything i can get sa said lowering his voice i mind sharing afew if 1
like you i bagman lowering his voice still the underdog anything i can do to said 1
harry so quickly he knew he had sounded know what.

e had ever been less got a plan worked i awhistle had blown got to said bagman in 1
and he hurried harry walked back to the tent and saw cedric emerging from to wish 1
him  luck  as he walked but all that came out of his a harry went back inside to 1
fleur and seconds they heard the which meant cedric had entered the enclosure and 2
was now counterpart of his it was worse than harry could ever have sitting there 1
and  the gasped like a single as cedric did whatever he was doing to get past the 1
swedish  krum  was still staring at taken to retracing around and around the and 1
commentary made everything much horrible pictures formed in mind as he narrow miss 2
very taking this move.

it and after about fifteen harry heard the deafening roar that cedric had gotten 1
past his dragon and captured the golden good bagman was now the marks from but he 2
shout  out  the  harry supposed the judges were them showing them to the three to 1
bagman yelled as the whistle blew if.

you  fleur was trembling from head to harry felt more warmly her far as she heft 1
the  tent  with  her  head  held high and her were left at opposite sides of the 1
avoiding each the same process started not sure that was they could hear shouting 1
careful  good  i  thought  had  it  ten minutes harry heard the crowd erupt into 1
applause once been successful a while marks were being more for the third.

the here comes cried and krum slouched leaving harry.

quite  he  felt  much  more  aware  of  his body than very aware and his fingers 1
tingling  with yet at the same he seemed seeing the walls of the and hearing the 1
as  though  bagman was and harry heard the chinese fireball emit a roaring while 1
the  crowd  drew its collective some nerve showing and got the applause shattered 1
the  wintery  air like breaking krum had be turn any he stood noticing dimly that 1
his legs seemed to be made then he heard the whistle he walked out through the entrance 1
nto a crescendo inside and now he was walking past the nclosure he saw everything 2
in  front  of him as though it was a very hundreds and hundreds of faces staring 1
down  at  him  from since last stood on this and there was the at the other end 1
rouched  low over her clutch of her wings her yellow black thrashing her spiked 1
heaving gouge marks in hard the crowd was making a great deal of but whether or 1
now or it was time to do what he had to to focus upon the thing that was his only 1
e  raised  he  harry  every  fiber  of him if it if it he seemed to be looking at 1
everything around him through some like a heat which made the enclosure and the.

hundreds  and  then he heard speeding through the air behind he hurtling toward 1
him around the edge of the soaring in midair beside waiting for him to the crowd 2
was bagman was shouting but ears were not working properly lhe swung his leg over 1
the  broom  and kicked off from the something miraculous as he soared as the wind 1
rushed through his as the pinpnicks and the horntail shrank to the size of a he that 1
ad  heft  not  only  the  ground  but also his he was back this was just another 1
quidditch that was just another quidditch horntail was just another ugly opposing 1
e  looked  down  at  the  clutch of eggs and spotted the colored residing safely 1
between the front harry.

told he the head followed he knew what it was going to do the dive just in a jet 2
of fire had been released exactly swerved but harry that was no more than dodging 2
he can yelled bagman as the crowd shrieked and watching harry soared higher in a 1
the  horntail  was still following his on its long neck he kept this it would be 1
nicely.

dizzy  would  be breathing fire harry plummeted just as the horntail opened its 1
but  this  missed the but the tail came whipping up to meet him one of the long 1
spikes grazed his ripping his robes he could feel it he could hear screaming and 1
groans from seem to be now he zoomed around the back of the and.

a the horntail seem to want to take she was too protective of writhed and furling 2
and unfurling her wings and keeping those she was afraid to move too far from but 2
he  had  to her never get near the trick was to do it he began to first this then 1
the  not  near  enough  to  make her him but still posing a sufficient threat to 1
ensure  she kept her this way and watching him out of those vertical her fangs he 1
flew the head rose with her neck now stretched to still hike a snake before its 1
arry  rose  a  few more and she let out a roar of he was she was longing to her 1
tail  thrashed but he was too to into the which he her jaws opened harry swerving 1
tantalizingly  above  come  and  get you get and then she spreading her leathery 1
wings at as wide as a small airplane harry before the dragon knew what he had or 1
isappeared  he  was  speeding toward the ground as fast as he unprotected by her 1
clawed  front  legs had taken his hands olden and with a huge spurt of he was he 1
was  soaring  out safely under his uninjured and it was as though somebody had up 1
the  first  he became properly aware of the noise of and applauding as loudly as 1
the  irish  supporters at the at bagman was you look at our youngest champion is 1
uickest to get his this is going to shorten the odds harry saw the dragon keepers 2
rushing  forward to subdue the at to the professor professor and hagrid hurrying 1
to meet all of them waving him toward their smiles evident even from the the noise 2
of  the crowd pounding his and came in to lighter than it had been in he had got 1
through  the  was  cried  professor  mcgonagall  as  he got off the from her was 1
extravagant  he  noticed  that  her hand as need to see madam pomfrey before the 1
judges  give  out your had to mop up diggory did said hagrid did the horntail yeh 1
now charlie said that was said harry so that hagrid blunder on and reveal that he 1
hown harry the dragons professor moody looked very pleased his magical eye was dancing 1
nd  easy does the the first aid said professor harry walked out of the still and 1
saw madam pomfrey mouth of a second.

looking  she in a disgusted pulling harry the tent was divided he could make out 1
shadow  through  the but cedric seem to be badly he was sitting at madam pomfrey 1
examined  talking  furiously  all the year this year what are they going to this 1
school very this is quite need cleaning before i.

heal she cleaned the cut with a dab of some purple liquid that shoulder with her 1
and he felt it heal just sit quietly for a minute and then you can go and get she 1
bustled out of the tent and he heard her go next door.

it  harry  want to sit he was too full of he got to his to what was going on but 1
before  reached  the mouth of the two darting inside followed closely by you were 1
hermione said there were fingernail marks on her where she had been clutching it 1
in were you but harry was looking at who was very white and.

staring  he  very  put your name in that goblet reckon trying to do you it was as 1
though the last few weeks had never happened for the first right after been made 1
ave said harry you long hermione stood nervously between looking from one to the 1
ron his mouth harry knew ron was about to apologize and suddenly to he before ron 2
could get the words.

said ron grinned nervously at and harry grinned back hermione burst into nothing to 2
cry harry told two are so she stamping her foot on the tears splashing her before 1
either of them could stop she had given dashed now positively said shaking his be 2
putting up your picking up the golden egg and his feeling more elated possible an 1
hour  harry  ducked  out of the ron by his were the you no cedric did this weird 1
thing  where he transfigured a rock on the turned it into a he was trying to for 1
the dog instead of it was a pretty cool bit of because he did get the but he got 2
burned as well through and decided it would rather have him than the fleur girl 1
tried this sort of i think she was trying worked it went all but then it and this 2
great  jet  of flame and caught fire put it out with a bit of water out of but he 1
even think of he was probably the best after hit some sort of spell right in the 1
only thing it went trampling half the real eggs took marks off for he supposed to 2
do ron drew breath as he and harry reached the edge of.

the been taken harry could see where the five judges were at raised seats draped in 1
arks out of ten from each ron and harry squinting up the judge maxime her wand in 2
the  what hooked like a long out of which twisted itself into a large figure said 1
ron as the crowd suppose she took marks off for.

your crouch came he shot a number nine into ron thumping harry on the he too put 1
up a the crowd was cheering harder than ludo bagman said harry in i got he playing 1
on  yelled  and  now karkaroff raised his he paused for a and then a his wand ron 1
bellowed you biased you gave krum but harry he have cared if karkaroff had given him 1
ndignation  on  his  behalf  was worth about a hundred points but his heart felt 1
lighter  than air as he turned to it those only gryffindors cheering in the when 1
it had come to had seen what he was most of the school had been on care about the 2
he could stand whatever they threw at tied in first you and said charlie hurrying 2
to  meet  them  as they set off back toward the got to got to an i swore tell her 1
what happened that was oh yeah me to tell you got to hang around for a few more a he 1
on  said  he  would so harry reentered the which somehow friendly and he thought 1
back  to  how felt while dodging the compared it to the long wait before walked 1
out to face there wait had been immeasurably and krum all came in one side of face 2
was  covered  in  a  thick orange which was presumably mending his he grinned at 1
harry.

he  said grinning all of said ludo bouncing into the tent and looking as pleased 1
hough  he personally had just got past a just a quick few long break before the 1
second  which will take place at half february the giving you something to think 1
about in the you look down at those golden eggs all you will see that hinges you 1
need to solve the clue inside the egg it will task and enable you to prepare for 1
all  off  harry  left  the  rejoined and they started to walk back talking harry 1
wanted  to hear what the other champions they rounded the clump of trees behind 1
which harry leapt out from it was rita she was wearing green robes the quill in her 1
and blended perfectly against she beaming at wonder if you could give me a quick 1
ow you felt facing that how you feel about the fairness.

of  you  can  have  a  said  harry  and he set off back to the castle chapter the 1
liberation front and hermione went up to the owlery that evening to find so harry 1
could  send  sirius  a  letter  telling  him that on the harry filled ron in on 1
everything  sirius  had  told shocked at first to hear that karkaroff had been a 1
death by owlery ron was saying that they ought to have suspected it he what malfoy 2

so  overexcited at the idea of a delivery he hooting ron snatched pigwidgeon out 1
of the air and him while harry attached the letter to his no way any of the other 1
tasks are going to be that how ron went on as he carried pigwidgeon to the know i 2
reckon  his harry knew that ron was only saying this to make up for his of but he 1
appreciated it all the leaned against the owlery and frowned got a long way to go 2
before  he finishes this she said was the first i hate to think coming little ray 1
of said and professor trelawney should get ogether he threw pigwidgeon out of the 2
pigwidgeon  plummeted  twelve to pull himself back up the letter attached to his 1

harry  dug  his  fingernails  into  around  it  and  prised  it it was hollow and 1
completely  empty  the  moment  harry  opened  aloud and screechy filled the the 1
nearest thing to it was the ghost orchestra at nearly headless deathday who had usical 1

appreciate  being  forced into boxes and nailed hagrid was soon while the skrewts 1
rampaged around the pumpkin now strewn with the the most of the class and goyle 1

their  wands  to jets fiery sparks at the which was advancing menacingly on over 1
its  try an slip the rope his so he won hurt any the we want ron shouted angrily 1
as  he  and harry backed into the of still holding the skrewt off with their this 1
does look like rita skeeter was leaning on garden looking in at the athick magenta 2

on top of the skrewt that was flattened a blast of fire shot out of its withering 2
the  hagrid  asked  rita  skeeter as he slipped a loop of the and tightened daily 1
prophet  rita  beaming  at her gold teeth dumbledore said you allowed inside the 1

creatures  she  beaming  still  more runted said apparently full of lively never 1

about but there was no way without rita skeeter so he had to stand and watch in as 1
ade arrangements to meet in the three broomsticks for a then the bell rang up at 1
the  signaling  the  end of the rita skeeter called merrily to him as he set off 1
with twist everything he harry said under his as long as he import those skrewts 1
illegally or said they looked at one another was exactly the sort of thing been in 2
loads of trouble and dumbledores never sacked said that can happen is have to get 2
rid  of  the  did  i say meant harry and hermione feeling slightly more went off 1
harry  thoroughly enjoyed double divination that they were star and but now that 1
he  and  ron were friends once the whole funny professor who had been so pleased 1
with  the  pair  been  predicting their own horrific quickly became irritated as 1
xplanation  of  the  various  ways  in  which pluto could disrupt would she in a 1
mystical  whisper  that  did  not  conceal  her  obvious  some  of  stared  very 1
meaningfully at be a little less seen what i have seen during my crystal gazing 1

hermione  down  but  instead of ending up in a gloomy underground like they found 1
themselves in a broad stone brightly lit with cheerful paintings that were mainly 2

over know what this is said he nudged ron and pointed to the painting just behind 2
a  ruit said cottoning trying to rope us into that spew stuff she said not ron the 1

brief glimpse of an large as the great hall with mounds of glittering brass pots 1
and  pans  heaped  around  the  and  fireplace at the other when something small 1
hurtled toward.

harry  next second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the hugging him so 1
tightly  he  thought his ribs would arry is it squealed the voice from somewhere 1
around  his  has  been  hoping and hoping to see harry and harry potter has come 1
dobby let go and stepped back a few beaming up at his eyes brimming with tears of 2
he looked almost exactly as harry remembered the the batlike the long fingers and 2
feet  the  which  were very when dobby had worked for the he had always worn the 1
same  filthy he was wearing the strangest assortment of garments harry he done an 1
even worse job of dressing himself than the at the tea cozy for a on which he had 2
pinned a number of bright horseshoes over a bare a pair of what looked like soccer 1
ne of harry was the black one harry had removed from malfoy into giving thereby 1
setting dobby the other was.

the  four long wooden tables that stood each of as passed was positioned exactly 1
beneath the four house tables the they were clear of dinner having but he supposed 1
hey had been laden with dishes that were then sent up.

the  at least a hundred little elves were standing around curtsying as dobby led 1
harry past they were all wearing the stamped with the hogwarts and as had like a 1
obby  stopped in front of the brick fireplace and e winky was sitting on a stool 1
by  the  unlike she had obviously she was wearing a neat little skirt and blouse 1
with  a  matching in it for her large while every one of strange of so clean and 1
well cared for that it looked winky was not clothes at there were soup stains all 2
down  her  blouse and aid lip then she burst into which spilled out of her great 1
splashed  down  her  just as they had done at the quidditch said she and ron had 1
followed  harry  and dobby to the lease but winky cried harder than on the other 1
beamed  up  at  harry  potter  like  a cup of he squeaked over aid about six came 1
trotting  up behind bearing a large silver tray with a cups for and a milk and a 1
large plate ron in an impressed hermione frowned at but the elves all looked they 2
bowed very low and long have you been harry asked as dobby handed around.

has been dismissed to new very difficult indeed at winky howled even her of a nose 2
dribbling  all  down  her  though she made no effort to stem the has traveled the 1
country  for  two whole trying to find dobby found because dobby wants paying the 1

not the point of a they and they slammed the door in dobby likes but he wants to 1

from as though carrying something remained where she though there was a definite 1
increase in the volume other harry dobby goes to visit and finds out winky has been 1
aid dobby at winky flung herself forward off her stool and lay on beating her tiny 2
fists upon it and positively screaming dropped down to her knees beside her and 1

cracked like a whip through the on and harry and ron both jumped and looked it was 2
the  end of the they had finished their the guinea changing into guinea pigs had 1
been shut away in a large still had they had copied down their homework from with 2
the ways in which transforming spells must be when performing the bell was due to 2
ring at any and harry and who had been having a sword fight with a couple of fred 1
ack  of the looked ron holding a tin parrot and a rubber that potter and weasley 1
have been kind enough to act.

floor  beak  had  severed  it  moments  to  say  to  you yule ball is approaching 1
traditional  part  of  the  triwizard  opportunity  for us to socialize with our 1
foreign  the  ball  will  be years and above you may invite a younger student if 1

as  she  nd  robes  will be professor mcgonagall the ball will start on christmas 1
finishing  at midnight in the great now professor mcgonagall stared deliberately 1
around the yule ball is of course a chance for us all to our isapproving lavender 1
giggled  harder  than  with her hand pressed hard harry could see what was funny 1
this  professor with her hair a looked as though she had never let her hair down 1
in  any  that does not professor mcgonagall went we will be relaxing standards of 1
behavior  we  expect from hogwarts i will be gryffindor student embarrasses the 1
school  in  any  the bell and there was the usual scuffle of activity swung them 1
onto  their  professor  mcgonagall  called  above  the  if  you assuming this had 1
something  to  do  with his headless rubber gloomily to the professor mcgonagall 1
waited  until  the  and  then  the  champions  and  their  partners aid profesor 1
mcgonagall looked suspiciously at as though she thought.

he  partners  for  the  yule she said dance insides seemed to curl up and he felt 1
himself going he said you said professor mcgonagall what telling the champions and 2
their partners open harry had a sudden mental image of himself in a top hat sort 1
of  frilly  dress  aunt  petunia  always  wore  to uncle not he is said professor 1
mcgonagall  are  a  hogwarts  and  you  will  do  what  is  expected of you as a 1
representative of.

so heard said professor mcgonagall in a very final sort of aweek harry would have 2
said finding a partner for a be to taking on a hungarian but now that he had done 2
the prospect of asking a girl to the he thought rather harry had never known so 1
many  people to put their names he always of because the alternative was usually 1
going back but he had always been very much in the minority.

before  everyone in the fourth year and above seemed to be and obsessed with the 1
coming  ball  at  least  all the girls hogwarts suddenly seemed to he had never 1
quite  noticed  that  whispering  in  the  girls shrieking with laughter as boys 1
comparing  notes  on what they were going to wear do they have to move in harry 1
asked ron as a dozen sniggering and staring at you supposed to get one on.

their  ron  any  idea  who  going harry he knew perfectly well whom like to but 1
working  up  was something cho was a year older than he she was she quidditch and 1
she  was  also very ron seemed to know what was going on inside not going to have 1

recently repaired ron had kept the a to he turned out to be quite ahufflepuff girl 2
to  whom  harry  had never spoken in his him to go to the ball with her the very 1
next  harry  even  stopped to consider the the girl walked off rather endure and 1
taunts  about  her all through history of the two more girls asked a second year 1
and  his  a  fifth  year though she might knock him out if he was quite said ron 1
after stopped was a foot taller than said still what look like trying to dance with 1
ords about krum kept coming back to only like him harry doubted very much if any 2
of  the  girls  who  had  would  have wanted to go to the ball with him if he a 1
ondered if this would bother him if cho asked on the harry had to admit that even 2
with the prospect of before life had definitely improved since he had got through 2
the  attracting  nearly  as much unpleasantness in the corridors which to do with 1
cedric  had  an  idea  cedric  might have told the gratitude for about the there 1
seemed to be fewer support badges around draco of was still quoting rita article 2
to  him  at  every  possible  but  he was getting fewer and fewer out to heighten 1
feeling of no story about hagrid had.

who had grown up listening to the that they were a very famous musical some of the 2

professor  for  from plowing on his notes on goblin rebellions binns let his own 1
death  stand they supposed a small thing like christmas going to put how he could 1
make even bloody and vicious goblin riots bottom professors mcgonagall and moody 1

in case it had a canary cream george confided to harry that he and fred were now 1

like  a frosted pumpkin next to the iced was while the durmstrang portholes were 1
glazed with the rigging with the down in the kitchen were outdoing themselves with 1
arming  stews and savory and only fleur delacour seemed to to complain is too all 1

this question on hoping to startle her into a she least expected hermione merely 1
frowned  and not telling just make fun of said behind not telling me asked that to 1

pulled  reply  off  harry  pocketed  and  they  hurried back to gryffindor tower 1
everyone in the common room was much too busy in observe what anyone else was up 2
and  hermione  sat apart from dark window that was gradually filling up with and 1

neville  changed into their dress robes up in their all of them looking very but 1
none  as much as who surveyed in long mirror in the corner with an appalled look 1
on  his  was fact that his robes looked more like a dress than anything them look 1
more  he  used  a severing charm on the ruff and it least he was now although he 1
done  a very neat and depressingly frayed as the boys set off still work out how 1
you two got the girls in the said ron pulling stray threads out of his the common 2

about having ron as a her dark eyes on frayed neck and sleeves of his dress robes 2

applauding them but was not the fifth seat at the table was occupied by when the 1

raised platform into existence along a several a a and some bagpipes were set upon 1
he  sisters now trooped up onto the stage to wildly they all extremely hairy and 1
dressed  in black robes that up their and who had been so interested in watching 1

other champions and their partners were parvati supposed to harry tripped over his 2
dress robes as he stood the weird mournful harry walked onto the brightly lit dance 1
ye could see seamus and dean waving at him and and parvati had seized his placed 1
one around her and was holding.

adame  maxime  and  hagrid  were  cutting a wide path around the as they waltzed 1
through the and karkaroff was nowhere to everybody applauded once and harry saw 1
ludo bagman kiss hand and make his way back through the at which point.

left the edged and slipped out into the entrance the front doors stood lights in 1
the rose garden winked and twinkled as found themselves surrounded by ornamental 2
and  large stone harry could hear splashing which sounded like a here and people 1
itting  on  carved  he and ron set off along one of the but they had gone only a 1
short way when they heard an familiar see what there is to fuss you cannot pretend 2
this karkaroffs voice sounded as though keen not to be been getting clearer and 1
becoming  seriously i deny it said snapes voice will make your remaining at snape 1
and  karkaroff  came around the snape had his wand out rosebushes his expression 1
most  squeals issued from many of dark shapes emerged points from snape snarled 1
as  a  girl  ran  past  from  hufflepuff as a boy went rushing after what are he 1
catching  sight  of  harry and ron on the path slightly discomposed to see them 1
standing his hand went began winding it around his re ron told snape against the is 1
nape and he brushed past his long black cloak out behind karkaroff hurried away 1
after  harry and ron down got karkaroff all since when have he and snape been on 1
said.

harry  they  had  reached  a  large  stone  reindeer over which tall the shadowy 1
outlines  of two enormous people were visible watching the water in the and then 1
harry  heard hagrid isaw i he was in an oddly husky harry and ron this sound like 1
the sort of scene harry looked back up the and saw fleur delacour and standing in 2
a  rosebush  he  tapped  ron  on the shoulder and toward meaning that they could 1
easily sneak off that way davies looked very busy to but eyes widening in horror at 1
is  head  and  pulled harry deeper into the shadows behind did you said madame a 1
purr  in  her  low  harry  definitely  want to listen to he knew hagrid would to 1
ituation  like  this certainly would it had been possible in his ears and hummed 1
but that really an instead he to himself in a beetle crawling along the stone but 2
enough to block out next knew you were like was it yer mother or yer know what you 1
as  my  said  hagrid  was  one the ones in i remember her too she when i was she 1
really the maternal not in their is dunno what happened to might be dead fer.

all  madame  maxime  say and in spite of took his eyes off the beetle and looked 1
over  the top of the he had never heard about his childhood dad was when she tiny 1
little my dad by the time i six i could lift him up put him on top the dresser if 2
deep  voice  madame  maxime  was apparently staring at the silvery raised but he 1
after i started sorta had ter make me own way after dumbledore was a real e hagrid 2
pulled  out  a large spotted silk handkerchief enough what about which side you 1
got it but madame maxime had suddenly got to is she said whatever the weather was 2
it  was  nowhere near as her think i will go in said hagrid don never met another 1
said  madame  her  tone harry could have told hagrid it was best not to he in his 1
hoping against hope he it was no sdare shrieked madame her voice exploded through 2
the  peaceful  like  a  behind  harry heard fleur and roger fall out of been more 1
insulted  in my i big she stormed great multicolored swarms of fairies rose into 1
pushing  aside  hagrid was still sitting on the staring it to make out his after 1
about a he stood up and strode not the but off out into the dark grounds in the direction 1
arry very quietly but.

ron said looking at ron looked around at his expression very serious you he hagrid 2
being arry he knew from the look ron was giving that he was once ignorance of the 1
wizarding  brought  up  by  the  there  were wizards took for granted that were 1
revelations to but had with each successive he could tell that most wizards would 2
not  upon  finding out that one of their friends had a giantess explain said ron 1
leur and roger davies had probably into a more private of and ron returned to the 2
great  parvati  and  padma were now whole crowd of beauxbatons and hermione was 1
once  more  with ron sat down at a table far removed from the harry prompted the 1
problem  with ron struggled for not very he finished harry nothing wrong with know 1
there  no  wonder he keeps it ron shaking his always thought got in the way of a 1
bad  engorgement  like  to  mention it matter if his mother was a said no one who 1
knows  him  will know not said just like hagrid in like they just like everyone 1
knows there any left in.

britain  happened  they  were dying out and then loads got themselves killed by 1
upposed  to  be  giants  they hide out in mountains know who maxime thinks harry 1
watching  madame  sitting  alone at the looking very she definitely big the only 1
thing  got  bigger  bones than her is a harry and ron spent the rest of the ball 1
discussing  in  having any inclination to harry tried not to watch cho and strong 1
desire  to kick when the weird sisters finished playing at everyone gave applause 1
and  started  to  wend their way into the entrance many wish that the ball could 1
have  gone  on but harry was happy far as he was the evening been much out in the 1
entrance  harry and ron saw hermione saying good went back to the durmstrang she 1
gave ron a very cold marble staircase without harry and ron followed but halfway 1
arry heard someone.

calling it was cedric harry could see cho waiting for him in the hall said harry 1
coldly as cedric ran up the stairs toward cedric looked as though he want to say 1
whatever it was in looking and continued to climb the cedric lowered his voice as 1
ron owe you one for me the you know that golden does yours wail when you open.

said take.

a  a and the egg with and mull things over in the hot help you trust harry stared 1
you cedric the fourth door to the left of that statue of boris the bewildered on 1
the fifth gotta go to say.

good  he  grinned at harry again and hurried back down the harry walked back to 1
gryffindor  tower that had been extremely would a bath help him to work out what 1
the wailing he trying to make harry look like a so cho would by the fat lady and 1
her  friend vi were snoozing in the over to yell before he woke them and when he 1
they were he climbed into the common room and found ron and a ten feet they were 1
bellowing  at  each  each  scarlet in the if you like you know what the solution 1
yelled  her hair was coming down out of its elegant bun and her ron yelled time a 1
ask me before someone else and not as a ron mouthed soundlessly like a goldfish 1
out  of  water as on stormed up the staircase to ron turned to look at he looking 1
just proves missed the oint harry say he liked being back on speaking terms with 1
ron  too his mind right now he somehow thought that hermione had than ron hapter 1
ita  everybody got up late on boxing the gryffindor common room it had been many 1
yawns  punctuating  the  lazy hair was bushy she confessed to harry that she had 1
used liberal amounts of for the way too much bother to do every she said scratching 1
urring crookshanks behind the ron and hermione seemed to have reached an unspoken 2
they were being quite friendly to each though oddly ron wasted no time in telling 2
hermione about the conversation they had maxime and but hermione seem to find the 2
news that hagrid a nearly as shocking as ron ithought he must she knew he be pure 1
giant  because about twenty feet but all this hysteria about they all be the same 1
sort of prejudice that people have toward.

just  ron  looked  as though he would have liked to reply but another because he 1
contented himself with shaking his.

head it was time now to think of the homework they had.

neglected everybody seemed to be feeling rather flat now that was except that who 2
was  starting  to  feel  slightly the trouble was that february the looked a lot 1
closer  and he still done anything about working out the clue therefore started 1
taking  the egg out of his trunk every he and listening hoping that this time it 1
would make some he what the sound reminded him apart from thirty musical else like 2
he  closed  the  shook  it and opened it again to but it he tried asking the egg 1
shouting over all the nothing he even threw the egg across the room he really o 1
arry  had  not  forgotten  the hint that cedric had given toward cedric just now 1
meant  that  he  was keen not to take it seemed to him that if cedric had really 1
wanted to give a alot more had told cedric exactly what was coming in the idea of 1
a fair exchange had been to tell harry to take of rubbishy help from someone who 1
kept walking down hand and so the first day of the new term and harry set off to 1
with  and  quills  as but also with the lurking worry as though he were carrying 1
that around with him snow was still thick upon the and the greenhouse windows were 1
ondensation  so  thick  that  they  see out of them in nobody forward to care of 1
magical  creatures  much in this though as would probably warm them up either by 1
chasing  or  blasting  off cabin would when they arrived at hagrid they found an 1
elderly  witch  cropped  gray hair and a very prominent chin standing before the 1
bell  rang five minutes she barked at them as her through the said staring at name 1
is professor she said am your temporary care magical harry repeated is said professor 1
oft  and  unpleasant  laughter  reached  harrys  he draco malfoy slytherins were 1
joining the all of them looked and to see professor said professor and she strode 2
off  around  the paddock where the beauxbatons horses were and hermione followed 1
ack  over  their  shoulders at all the curtains were was hagrid alone wrong with 1
harry  hurrying to catch up with professor you she said as though she thought he 1
was  being  do said harry up with professor acted as though she hear she led them 1
where  the  huge  beauxbatons  horses were huddled against the a the edge of the 1
where  a large and beautiful unicorn was many of the girls at the sight of the so 1
whispered lavender did she get supposed to be really hard.

with  its golden hooves and throwing back keep barked professor throwing out an 1
arm and catching hard in the prefer the girls to the and approach with come easy does 1
he  and  the  girls  walked slowly forward toward the leaving paddock the moment 1
professor was out of harry turned o reckons wrong with you think a skrewt he been 1

left the castle and the frozen grounds to they and booming harry pounding on the 1
agrid  they could hear fang scratching at the but it they hammered on it for ten 1
more ron even went and on but there was no he avoiding us hermione said when they 1
had  finally given up back to the surely think care about him being but it seemed 1
that  hagrid  did  they see a sign of him all he the staff table at they see him 1
going  about  his gamekeeper and professor continued to take the care of magical 1
alfoy  was  gloating at every possible your he kept whispering to harry whenever 1
there  was  a  teacher  so  that he was safe from the there was a hogsmeade visit 1
halfway  through  hermione  was  harry  was  going  to  just thought want to take 1
advantage  of the common room being get to work on that ireckon got a pretty good 1
idea what about harry you said looking harrys insides gave a guilty but he ignored 2
he  still  that  egg  after  and that was whereas if he went and get a chance to 1
persuade  him  to and hermione left the castle together on saturday and set off 1
rounds  toward  the as they passed the durmstrang ship moored viktor krum emerge 1
onto  the  dressed  in nothing but swimming but apparently a lot tougher than he 1
because  he climbed up stretched out his and right into the said staring at krums 1
dark head as it bobbed out into the must a lot colder where he comes said suppose 2
it  feels  quite  but  still  the giant said he sound anxious he sounded hermione 1
noticed his tone of voice really you she not at all like coming from he likes it 1
much  better he told ron said he mentioned viktor krum since the but harry had a 1
iniature arm under his bed on boxing which had.

looked  snapped  off a small model figure wearing bulgarian quidditch harry kept 1
his  eyes  skinned  for  a sign of hagrid all the suggested a visit to the three 1
broomsticks once he the the pub was as crowded as but one quick look hagrid heart 2
he  went  up  to the bar with ron and ordered butterbeers from madam and thought 1
gloomily that he behind and listened to the egg wailing after he ever go into the 2
hermione  whispered  she  pointed  into the mirror behind the and harry saw in a 1
shadowy corner with a bunch of bagman was talking very all of whom had their arms 2
crossed  and  were looking it was indeed harry that bagman was here at the three 1
weekend  when  there  was  no triwizard and therefore no to bagman in the he was 1
looking  strained  quite as strained as forest before the dark mark had but just 1
then bagman over and stood ain a harry heard him say brusquely to the and hurried 1
through  the  pub  toward his boyish grin back in he are been hoping to run into 1
everything  going all aid if i could have a private said give us a you could said 1
and  he and hermione went off to find bagman led harry along the bar to the end 1
furthest  from ijust thought congratulate you again on your said said but he knew 1
this be all that bagman wanted to could have congratulated harry in front of ron 2
and bagman in particular rush to spill the harry saw him glance into the who were 1
all  watching  him  and  harry  in  silence  through said bagman to harry in an 1
noticing harry watching the goblins english too like being back with all the bulgarians 1
uidditch  world but at least they used sign language lot keep gabbling in and i 1
only  know  one word of means i like to use it in case they think threatening he 1
gave a booming do they harry noticing how the goblins were still.

bagman said looking suddenly looking for.

barty  are they looking for him said at the ministry in amatter of no idea where 1
he  said  sort  stopped  coming  to  been absent for a couple of weeks young his 1
pparently  just  been sending instructions in by but would to because rita still 1
poking  around  everywhere she and to bet work up bartys illness into something 1
probably  say  gone  ertha  you  heard  anything  about bertha harry said looking 1
strained got people of.

course thought all very she definitely arrived in because she her second cousin 1
and then she left the house to go an she seems to have vanished without trace en 1
blowed  if  i  to  seem the type to for but what are we talking about goblins and 1
bertha i really wanted to ask lowered his voice are you with your golden not harry 2
said bagman seemed to know he being he said in a very low feel very bad about all 1
you thrown into this you volunteer for and voice was harry had to lean closer to 2
i can help at a prod in the liking to the way you got past that just say the harry 2
stared  up  into  rosy face and his supposed to work out the clues he careful to 1
keep  his  casual and not sound as though he was accusing the head and sports of 1
breaking said bagman harry all want a.

hogwarts you offered cedric harry the smallest of frowns creased smooth i he like 2
i  taken a liking to just thought offer said i think nearly there with the couple 1

anyone  harry  went back to afternoon with ron and unable to banish the image of 1
the whiskery face as he had imagined harry winning the egg weighed more heavily 1
than  ever  on  harrys  conscience got into he had made up his mind was time to 1
shelve  was worth hapter the egg and the eye harry had no idea how long a bath he 1
would need to work out decided to do it at when he would be able to take as much 1
hough he was to accept more favors from he also decided to far fewer people were 1
allowed in so it was much less he harry planned his excursion because he had been 2
caught  bounds  by  filch  the  caretaker  in  the  middle  of the night the the 1
invisibility  cloak  of  be  and  as  an  added  harry thought he would take the 1
marauders next to the was the aid to harry the map showed the whole of including 1
its  shortcuts  and  secret  passageways most important of it revealed castle as 1
labeled  moving  around  the  so  that  harry  would  forewarned if somebody was 1
approaching  the on thursday harry sneaked up to put on the crept back just as he 1
had  done on the night when hagrid had shown to this time it was ron who waited 1
outside to give the fat ron climbing into the room as harry crept out past it was 1
awkward  moving  under  the  cloak because harry had the arm and the map held in 1
front  of  his  nose with the the empty and and by checking the map at strategic 1
harry was run into anyone he wanted to when he reached the statue of awizard with 1
his  gloves on the wrong he located the leaned close to and muttered the just as 1
cedric had the door creaked harry slipped bolted the door behind and invisibility 2
his  immediate  reaction was that it would be worth becoming this it was softly 1
lit  by  a  splendid  and  everything was of white including what looked like an 1
rectangular  swimming  pool  middle of the about a hundred golden taps stood all 1
around  the differently colored jewel set into its there was also a curtains hung 1
at  the  a  large  pile of fluffy white sat single painting on the it featured a 1
blonde mermaid was fast asleep on a her long hair over her it.

fluttered  harry  moved  looking his footsteps echoing off the the bathroom was 1
quite  keen  though  he was to try out a here he quite suppress the feeling that 1
cedric  might have been earth was this supposed to help solve the mystery of the 1
uffy the the and the egg at the side of the sized knelt down and turned on a few 1
of  the he could tell at once that they carried different sorts of bath though it 1
bubble  bath  as  harry had ever experienced bubbles the size of another poured 1
white  foam  so  thick  have  supported his weight if cared to test a third sent 1
overing  over  the  surface  of  the  harry  amused himself for the particularly 1
enjoying the effect of one whose jet bounced when the deep pool was full of hot 1
and  which  took a time considering its harry turned off all the pulled off his 1
ressing and slid into the it was so deep that his feet barely touched the and he 1
before  swimming  back to the side and treading staring at it was to swim in hot 1
and  foamy  water with clouds of steam no stroke of brilliance came to no sudden 1
burst  harry  stretched  out  his lifted the egg in his wet and screeching sound 1
filled  the echoing and reverberating off sounded just as incomprehensible as if 1
not more so with all worried that the sound would attract wondering whether that 1
lan  making  him jump so badly that he dropped the which the bathroom someone try 1
putting it in the if i were harry had swallowed a considerable amount of bubbles 1
in he stood saw the ghost of a very girl sitting on top of one of the moaning who 1
was usually to be heard sobbing in the of a.

three harry said in not the foam was so dense that this hardly but he had a nasty 1
een spying on him from out of one of the taps ever since closed my eyes when you 1
got  she  blinking  at him through her been to see me for said bending his knees 1
just  to  make  absolutely sure myrtle see anything but his not supposed to come 1
into your am.

a  used  to said myrtle used to be in there all the this was though only because 1
and  hermione had toilets a convenient place to brew polyjuice potion in him and 1
ron  into  living replicas of crabbe and goyle for an the slytherin got told off 1
for going in said which was percy coming out of myrtles thought better not come 1
back after see said picking at a spot on her chin in a morose sort try the egg in 1
the  what  cedric  diggory you been spying on him said harry sneak up here in the 1
evenings to watch the prefects take said rather never come out to speak to.

anyone said harry keep your eyes he made sure myrtle had her glasses well covered 2
before  wrapping  the towel firmly around his and going to retrieve he the myrtle 1
peered  through  her fingers and open it under harry lowered the egg beneath the 1
foamy surface and a gurgling song was coming out of a song whose words.

he  need  to  put your head under said who seemed to be thoroughly bossing harry 1
took a great breath and slid under the surface on the he heard a chorus of eerie 1
voices singing to him.

in  seek us where our voices we cannot sing above the and while you re ponder wove 1
taken  what an hour long have to and to recover what we but past an hourthe too it 1
wont come harry let himself float back upward and broke the bubbly.

his said seek us where our voices and if i need persuading i need to listen he sank 2
back beneath the it took three more underwater of the before harry had it then he 2
trod water for a thinking and watched got to go and look for people who use their 1
voices above who could.

that  he  had  never  seen moaning myrtle so apart from the day potion had given 1
hermione  the  hairy  face and tail of a thinking the voices could only be heard 1
then it made underwater he ran this theory past who smirked at thats what diggory 2
she  lay there talking to himself for ages ages and nearly all the bubbles harry 1
said what lives in the apart from the.

giant  all  she  sometimes go down sometimes have any someone flushes my toilet 1
when not trying not to think about moaning myrtle zooming down a of a harry does 2
anything in there have a human eyes had fallen on the picture of the snoozing mermaid 1
here merpeople in are very she her thick glasses took diggory much longer than and 2
that was with her awake jerked her head toward the an expression of great dislike 2
on her glum face and showing.

off  said  harry  second  tasks  to  go and find the merpeople in lake and but he 1
suddenly realized what he was and he felt the out though someone had just pulled 1
a plug in his he a very never had much dudley had had lessons in his but aunt no 1
doubt  hoping  that  harry would drown one bothered to give couple of lengths of 1
this  bath were all very but merpeople would surely live right at the harry said 1
am  i supposed to at eyes filled with sudden tears she groping in her robes for a 1
about breathing in front of she said and her voice the i when i not for ages she 1
buried  her  face  in her handkerchief and sniffed myrtle had always been about 1
being  but none of the bout he said mean just very easy to forget said looking at 1
him out swollen missed me even when i was took them hours and body i was sitting 2
there waiting for olive hornby came the you in here she professor dippet asked me 2
to look for and then she saw my she forget it until her dying i made followed her 2
around and reminded i i remember at her but harry he was thinking about the song taken 1
hat  you ii sorely that sounded as though they were going to something he had to 1
get what were they going to of she went to the ministry of magic to stop me stalking 1
ome back here and live in said harry a lot further on than i shut your eyes will 1
he retrieved the egg from the bottom of the climbed pajamas and dressing gown you 2
come and visit me in my bathroom again moaning mournfully as harry picked up the 2
harry  though  privately thinking the only way be visiting bathroom again was if 1
every  other  toilet  in the castle got for our she said and as harry put on the 1
invisibility  cloak  he saw back up out in the dark harry examined the marauders 1
map to check the dots belonging to filch and his were safely nothing else seemed 1
to  be moving apart from though he was the room on the floor harry had taken his 1
first  step back something else on the map caught his something distinctly peeves 1
was  not  the  only  thing  that  was a single dot was bottom corner but the dot 1
labeled  bartemius  harry stared at the crouch was supposed to be too ill to yule 1
ball what was he sneaking into hogwarts at one in.

the  watched  closely  as the dot moved around and around the harry and then his 1
curiosity got the better of he the opposite direction toward the nearest he was 1
going to harry walked down the stairs as quietly as though the faces still turned 1
curiously at the squeak of a the rustle of corridor pushed aside a tapestry about 2
halfway  and  proceeded  ashortcut that would take him down two he kept glancing 1
ondering just seem in for crouch to be sneaking around somebody office this late at 1
nd  halfway  down  the  not  thinking  about what he was not on anything but the 1
peculiar behavior of harrys leg sank trick step neville always forgot to he gave 1
an  ungainly  damp  from the slipped from under his he lurched forward to the egg 1
fell down the long staircase with a bang as loud as a invisibility cloak slipped 1
snatched  at  and the marauder s map and slid down six sunk in the step to above 1
his  he  the  golden  egg fell through the tapestry at the bottom of the wailing 1
loudly in the corridor harry pulled out his wand and marauder s to wipe it but it 2
was too far away to reach pulling the cloak back over himself harry straightened 1
listening up with almost.

immediately  it  was  the  unmistakable  hunting  cry  of filch the harry could 1
huffling  footsteps  coming  nearer and his wheezy voice this wake up the whole 1
will  have have and what is footsteps there was a clink of metal on metal and the 1
ad picked up the egg and closed harry stood very one magical any moment filch was 2
going to pull aside the expecting to see and there would be no peeves if he came 1
up  the  he  would  and invisibility cloak or the map would show standing exactly 1
where he filch said quietly at the foot of the norris was obviously with him is a 1
triwizard  this  belongs to a harry felt his heart was hammering very fast filch 1
roared been he ripped back the tapestry and harry saw his pouchy face eyes staring 2
up  the  dark  and deserted are he said coming to get gone and stolen a triwizard 1
have you out of here for you.

pilfering  filch  started to climb the his cat at his like so very like her were 1
fixed directly upon he had now to wonder whether the invisibility cloak worked on 2
sick  watched  filch  drawing  nearer  and  nearer in his old flannel to pull his 1
trapped leg but it merely sank a few going to spot the map or walk right into him 1
hats filch stopped a few steps below harry and at the foot person who could make 1
situation he was wearing a long.

gray  and  he  looked  filch  whispered threw this egg down snape climbed up the 1
stairs quickly and stopped beside convinced his loudly thumping heart would give 1
him  away  at  said snape staring at the egg in peeves get egg was in your course 1
snape heard banging and wailing that was the egg was coming to investigate threw professor 1
hen i passed my i saw that the torches were lit and a somebody has been searching 1
ut peeves know he snape snapped seal my office with a spell none but wizard could 1
snape  looked up the straight through and corridor want you to come and help me 1
search  for  the rofessor filch looked yearningly up the right through who could 1
see that reluctant to forgo the chance of cornering harry pleaded with norris was 1
peering  around  harry  had  the  distinct impression she could smell why had he 1
filled that bath with so thing said filch headmaster will have to listen to me this 1
eeves has been stealing from a it might be my chance to get castle once and for all 1
give a damn about that wretched my.

office  snape stopped talking very he and filch both looked down harry saw moody 1
limp into sight through the narrow gap was wearing his old traveling cloak over 1
his nightshirt on is he growled up the snape and i heard said filch at the throwing 2
things around as usual then professor snape discovered into his off snape hissed to 1
oody took a step closer to the foot of the harry saw moodys and harrys heart gave 2
a horrible moody could see through he see the full strangeness of the snape in his 2
filch clutching the and trapped in the stairs lopsided gash of a mouth opened in 1
for a few he and stared straight into each then moody closed his mouth nape ihear 1
that he asked broke into your is said snape the growled is very want to break into 2
i  said  harry  could see a vein flickering horribly greasy has happened potion 1
ingredients have gone missing store cupboard attempting illicit no they were after 2
potion said hiding anything else.

in  your  are  harry  saw  the edge of snapes sallow face turn a nasty brick the 1
ulsing  more  know hiding he said in a soft and searched my office pretty moodys 1
face twisted into a dumbledore told me to keep.

an happens to trust said snape through clenched refuse to that he gave you orders 2
to search dumbledore trusts growled a trusting believes second but me say there 1
are spots that come spots know what i snape suddenly did something very he seized 1
his  left  with  right  as  though something on it had hurt moody back to have the 1
authority  to  send  me  snape letting go of his though angry with have as much 1
right  to  prowl  this  school  said  but his voice was full of look forward to 1
meeting  in  a  dark corridor some dropped by the with a stab of harry saw moody 1
point at the marauders staircase six steps below as snape and filch both turned to 1
he  he  raised his arms under the cloak and waved furiously at outhing snape had 1
reached out for a horrible expression of dawning.

on the map flew up into the slipped through snapes outstretched stairs into moodys 1
oody said mine dropped it but black eyes were darting from the egg in arms to the 1
nd  harry  could tell he was putting two and two as he said moody folding up the 1
map  and  snape  and  he actually turned his head and stared harry as though he 1
could  suddenly  see  egg  is potters that parchment belongs to i have seen it i 1
recognize  potter nvisibility snape stretched out his hands like a blind man and 1
began  to  have sworn his nostrils were trying to sniff harry out harry trying to 1
avoid  snapes  but any moment now nothing barked be happy to tell the headmaster 1
quickly your mind jumped to harry snape turned again to look at his hands still inches rom 1
hat  very interested to know got it in for that said limping nearer still to the 1
foot of the so am very torchlight flickered across his mangled so that the and the 1
is  looked  deeper  and  darker than snape was looking down at and harry see the 1
expression on nobody moved or said then snape slowly lowered his merely said in a 1
voice of forced if potter was.

wandering after hours again an unfortunate habit of his should.

be  i  said  moody best interests at have there was a snape and moody were still 1
staring at each gave still peering around looking for the source think i will go 1
back  to snape said idea had all said if just give me that said clutching the egg 1
as  though  it  were his firstborn is evidence of the property of the champion he 1
stole  it  said  hand it snape swept downstairs and passed moody without another 1
noise to who stared blankly at harry for a few more following her still breathing 2
very  harry  heard snape walking filch handed moody the egg and disappeared from 1
view to my see dumbledore in the morning him what peeves was.

up  a  door harry was left staring down at who placed his staff bottommost stair 1
and  started to climb laboriously toward a he said harry is this said drawing the 1
map out of his pocket unfolding of said hoping moody was going to pull him out of 2
his leg was really hurting moody staring at the his magical eye going this is some 1
uite harry his eyes were starting to water from professor think you could help of 1
oody  took  hold of harrys arms and harrys leg came free of climbed onto the one 1
above moody was still gazing at he said by any to see who broke into did on this i 1
harry  moodys  magical eye whizzed over the entire surface of the e aid not here 1
said his eye still whizzing over very he said nothing for almost a still staring 1
at the harry could meant something to moody and very much wanted to know it dared 1
moody scared him yet moody had just helped him.

avoid why reckon crouch wanted to look around snapes moodys magical eye left the 1
map and upon it was and harry had the impression that moody was sizing him or how 2
much  to  tell  it  this  moody  muttered say old obsessed with catching dark but 1
nothing to barty he continued to stare at the harry was burning to.

know  he said could this have anything to do maybe crouch thinks something going 1
aid  moody  harry  wondered  how  much he dare he want moody to guess information 1
outside that might lead to tricky questions harry stuffs been happening been in the 1
aily  the  dark  mark at the world and the death eaters and both of mismatched a 1
sharp he his magical eye roved back to the could be thinking along those he said 1
there  have  some  funny  rumors  flying around lately along by rita of a lot of 1
people i a grim smile twisted his lopsided if one thing i he more to himself than 2
to  and  his  magical  eye corner of the a death eater who walked harry stared at 1
could  moody possibly mean what harry he now i want to ask you a said moody in a 1
more businesslike harrys heart he had thought this was moody was going to ask this 2
which was a very dubious magical object the story of hands incriminated not only 2
but  his  own  fred and their last defense against the dark arts moody waved who 1
braced  himself  said  he  was very fond of his but on the other he was relieved 1
sking where got and there was no doubt that he.

owed  growled  can make good use of this might be exactly what been looking come 1
hey  climbed  to the top of the stairs moody still the map atreasure the like of 1
which he had never seen they in where he stopped and looked up at ever thought of 1
a career as an said taken want to consider said nodding and looking at harry indeed 2
incidentally guessing you werent just taking that said been working out the moody 2
winked at his magical eye going haywire like a nighttime to give you see you in the 1
e went back into his staring down at the marauders map bharry walked slowly back 1
to  gryffindor lost in thought about what it all why was crouch pretending to be 1
if  he  could when he wanted what did he think snape was concealing in and moody 1
thought  ought  to  be  an  interesting but harry as he got quietly into his ten 1
minutes  the egg and the back in his he thought like to check how scarred the it 1
as a chapter.

six the second task you said already worked out that egg said hermione your voice 1
said harry just need to of all and hermione were sitting at the very back of the 1
charms  with  they  were supposed to be practicing the opposite of the banishing 1
owing to the potential for nasty accidents when the professor flitwick had given 1
each student a stack of theory being that these hurt anyone if they went off it 1
orking  very  aim  was  so poor that he kept accidentally sending heavier things 1
flying  across  the  room for forget the egg for a all harry hissed as professor 1
resignedly past landing on top of a large trying to tell.

you  this class was an ideal cover for a private as everyone was fun to pay them 1
any harry had been recounting his of the whispered installments for the last half 1
aid  moodys  searched his office as ron his eyes alight as he banished a cushion 1
with a sweep of his wand hat reckon here to keep an eye on snape as well i dunno 1
if  what  dumbledore  asked  him  to but definitely said waving his wand without 1
paying much so that his cushion did belly flop off the said dumbledore only lets 1
snape  stay  here  him a second chance or said his eyes his next cushion spinning 1
high  into off the and dropping heavily onto maybe moody snape put your name in 1
the goblet of said shaking her head thought snape was trying to kill harry and it 1
turned  out he was saving she banished a cushion and it flew across the room and 1
upposed to be aiming harry looked at it was true that his life but the odd thing 2
snape  definitely  loathed  just father when they had been at school snape loved 1
certainly  never missed an opportunity to give him or even be suspended from the 1
are  what  moody hermione went not he was right trust hagrid and professor even 1
though  loads  of people so why he be right about even if snape is a bit said ron 1
why are all these dark wizard catchers searching has crouch been pretending to be 2
said  ignoring  a  bit that he cant manage to come to the yule but he can of the 1
night  when he just like crouch because of that said sending a cushion into just 1
want to think snapes up to said sending her zooming neatly into the just want to 1
know what snape did with his first if on his said harry and his to his very great 2
flew straight across the neatly on top.

of  obedient  to wish of hearing about anything odd at harry sent brown owl that 1
explaining all about crouch breaking into and then harry turned his attention in 1
earnest  to the facing how to survive underwater for an hour on the of ron quite 1
liked the idea of using the summoning charm had and ron see why harry summon one 1
from the nearest muggle hermione squashed this plan by pointing out in the unlikely 1
o learn how to operate an within the set limit of an he disqualified for breaking 2
the  international  code  of  wizarding to that no muggles would spot an zooming 1
across the the ideal solution would be for you to transfigure hermione only done 2
human  transfiguration but i think we start that until sixth and it can go badly 1
wrong  if  ifancy  walking  around with a periscope sticking out of icould always 1
attack  someone in front of he might think let you choose what you wanted to be 1
turned said ithink your best chance is some sort of so thinking that he would soon 2
have  had  enough of the to buried himself once more among the dusty looking for 1
any  human  to  survive  without  though  and  hermione searched their and whole 1
weekends  harry  asked  professor  mcgonagall for anote of permission to use the 1
restricted  and  even  asked  madam for help found nothing whatsoever that would 1
enable  to  spend an hour underwater and live to tell the familiar flutterings of 1
panic were starting to disturb harry to concentrate in class the which harry had 1
always  taken  feature  of the drew his eyes whenever he was near a gray mass of 1

sitting at the table crouch to turn said ludo who was looking intensely relieved 1
to see him catch his dumbledore smiled at but karkaroff and madame maxime look see 1
it  was obvious from the looks on their faces that they harry bent hands on his 1
gasping  for  he had a stitch in his though he had a knife between his but there 1
was no to now moving among the spacing them along the bank at intervals of was on 1
the very end of the next to who was wearing holding his wand bagman whispered as 1
he  moved  harry  a  few  feet farther what going to harry massaging bagman gave 1
shoulder a quick squeeze and returned to the he wand at his throat as he had done 2
at the world and across the dark water toward the all our champions are ready for 2
the second which.

on  the  whistle  echoed  shrilly  in  the still the stands erupted with without 1
looking to see what the other champions were pulled the handful of gillyweed out 2
of  his  stuffed  it into it was so cold he felt the skin on his legs searing as 1
odden  robes  weighed  him down as he walked in now the his rapidly numbing feet 1
were  slipping  over  silt and slimy he gillyweed as hard and fast as he it felt 1
unpleasantly slimy in the freezing water he and waited for something.

to  he could hear laughter in the crowd and knew he without showing any sign of 1
magical  the  part of him that was goose half immersed in the icy a cruel breeze 1
lifting  to  shiver  he  avoided  looking  at  the the laughter was becoming were 1
catcalls and jeering from the quite harry felt as though an invisible pillow had 1
been  and  he  tried  to  draw  but  it made his head his lungs suddenly felt a 1
piercing  pain  on  either  side  of his neck harry clapped his hands around his 1
throat  and  felt two in the cold he had without pausing to he did the only flung 1
himself forward into the the first gulp of icy lake water felt like the breath of 1
ook another great gulp of water and felt it pass his to his he stretched out his 1
hands  in  front  of him and at ghostly under the and they had become he twisted 1
feet had become elongated and the toes were webbed it looked as though he had sprouted 1
he  water  feel  icy anymore either the he felt pleasantly harry struck out once 1
marveling  at how far and fast his like him through the and noticing how clearly 1
he  could  and  how need to he had soon swum so far into the lake that he flipped 1
over  and dived into silence pressed upon his ears as he soared over a only see 1
ten feet around so that as he sped throuugh suddenly out of the incoming forests 2
of tangled black mud littered with glimmering he swam deeper and out the his eyes 2
staring  through  the  eerily water around where the water small fish flickered 1
past him like silver once or twice he larger moving ahead of but when he got he 1
discovered  it  blackened or a dense clump of there was no sign of ron the giant 1
ight green weed stretched ahead of him as far as he could of very overgrown harry 2
was  staring  unblinkingly  ahead  of  trying  through the and without something 1
grabbed hold of his harry twisted his body around and saw a a horned water poking 2
out  of the its long fingers clutched tightly around its pointed stuck his webbed 1
hand quickly inside his robes and fumbled.

for  grasped  two  more  grindylows  had  risen  out  of the had seized and were 1
attempting to drag harry except that no sound came a large bubble issued and his 1
instead  of  sending  sparks  at the pelted them with to be a jet of boiling for 1
where  it  struck angry red on harry pulled his ankle out of the grindylows grip 1
and  as  as occasionally sending more jets of hot water over his felt one of the 1
grindylows snatch at his foot and he he connect with a horned and looking saw the 2
dazed  grindylow while its fellows shook their fists at harry and sank back harry 1
slowed  down  a slipped his wand back inside listening he turned full circle in 1
the the silence than he knew he must be even deeper in the lake but nothing ippling 1
re you getting harry thought he was having a heart he whipped around and floating 2
hazily  in  front of gazing at him through her harry tried to shout once nothing 1
came  out of his mouth a moaning myrtle actually want to try over she come with i 1
like  them  they  always  chase  me when i get too harry gave her the to show his 1
thanks and set off once careful higher over the weed to avoid any more grindylows 2
that  might  he swam on for what felt like at least twenty he was black mud which 1
swirled murkily as he disturbed the at snatch of haunting hour long have to and to 1
recover  what  we  harry swam faster and soon saw a large rock emerge out of the 1
aintings  of  merpeople  on  they  were  carrying spears harry swam on past the 1
following  the  your  half  so tarry lest what you seek stays here to acluster of 1
crude stone dwellings stained with algae loomed here and there at the dark harry 1
saw  faces  that  bore no to the painting of the mermaid in the the merpeople had 1
grayish skin and dark green their as were their broken and they wore thick ropes 1
of  pebbles  around harry as he swam one or two of them emerged from silver fish 1
tails  beating  the  spears  clutched  in  their harry sped staring and soon the 1
dwellings became more there gardens of weed around some of and he even saw a pet 1
grindylow  a  one merpeople were emerging on all sides watching him at his webbed 1
hands and talking behind their hands to one harry and a very strange sight met his 1
whole crowd of merpeople was floating in front of the.

that  of a village a choir of merpeople was singing in the champions toward and 1
behind  them  rose a crude sort of from a four people were bound tightly to the 1
tail of ron was tied between hermione and cho there was also than whose clouds of 2
silvery  hair made harry feel sure she all four of them appeared to be in a very 1
deep  their and fine streams of bubbles kept issuing from harry sped toward the 1
half expecting the merpeople to lower at but they did the ropes of weed tying the 2
hostages  and very for a fleeting second he thought of the knife sirius christmas 1
in  his trunk in the castle a quarter of a mile he looked many of the merpeople 1
surrounding  them  were carrying swiftly toward a merman with a long green beard 1
and  a choker of tried to mime a request to borrow the the merman laughed do not 1
he said in a croaky harry said fiercely only bubbles issued from his and he to the 2
spear away from the but the merman yanked it.

still  harry  swirled  staring there were rocks littering the lake he dived and 1
snatched  up  a  and  returned to the he began to hack at the ropes and hard they 1
broke  ron  a few inches above the lake drifting a little in the ebb of the harry 1
looked  there  was no sign of any of the other playing why they hurry he turned 1
back  to  raised the jagged began to hack at her bindings too at several pairs of 1
strong  gray  hands  seized half a away from shaking their take your own one of 1
them  said  to  the said harry furiously only two large bubbles your task is to 1
retrieve  your  own leave the others gesturing toward an enormous silver bubble 1
emerging  from  his  iwant  them  to die head was on hermiones the small girl was 1
ghostly  green and harry struggled to fight off the but they laughed harder harry 1
looked wildly where were the other would he have time ron to the surface and come 2
back down for hermione them he looked down at his watch to see how much time.

was but then the merpeople around him pointed excitedly over his cedric swimming 1
toward  there  was  an  enormous  bubble  around his features look oddly wide he 1
looking and feeling enormously harry watched cedric pull a knife out of he pulled 2
her  upward  and  out  of harry looked where were fleur and time was getting and 1
ccording  to  the  the  hostages  would  be  lost after an the merpeople started 1
screeching  those  holding harry loosened behind harry turned and saw something 1
monstrous cutting ahuman body in swimming trunks with the head of a.

it transfigured the man swam straight to hermione and began snapping and trouble 2
was that new teeth were positioned very than a and harry was quite sure that if 1
krum  he  was  to hermione in darting harry hit krum hard on the shoulder up krum 1
seized it and began to cut hermione within he had hermione around the and without 2
a  backward began to her he now harry thought if he could be sure that fleur was 1
but  no there was nothing to be he snatched up the which krum had but the mermen 1
now  in  ron  and  the little shaking their heads at harry pulled out of the only 1
bubbles flew out of his but he had the distinct understood because they suddenly 2
stopped  their  yellowish eyes and they looked there might be a lot more of them 1
but  harry  could  by the looks on their that they knew sgot until harry a great 1
stream of bubbles burst from up three fingers to make sure they got the put down 1
ut down a second they harry darted forward and began to hack at the ropes the and 1
at  last she was he seized the little girl around rons and kicked off from the it 1
was very slow he could no longer use his webbed worked his flippers but ron and 1
sister  were  like sacks him back he fixed his eyes though he knew he must water 1
above him was so merpeople were rising with he could see them swirling around him 1
struggle  through  the would they pull him back down to was did they perhaps eat 1
legs  were  seizing  up  with the to his shoulders were aching horribly with the 1
effort  of ron he was drawing breath with extreme he could feel pain on again was 1
becoming very aware of how wet the water was was definitely thinning he could see 2
daylight  above  he  kicked  hard  with his flippers and discovered that they was 1
flooding through his mouth into his lungs was to and air were only ten feet above 2
him had to get there had to harry kicked his legs so hard and fast it felt as though 1
is very brain felt he he needed he had to keep he could not and then he felt his 1
head break the surface of the air his wet face he gulped it feeling as though he 1
had  never pulled ron and the little girl up with all around were emerging out of 1
the  water  with  but  they were smiling at the crowd in the stands was making a 1
great deal of and seemed to be on their harry had the impression they ron might be 2
but  they  were  both of them had opened their the and but ron merely expelled a 1
great spout of blinked to and then he spotted did you bring.

her  turn i leave harry you said take that song thing did dumbledore have let any 1
of us song said was only to make sure you got back inside the time said waste time 1
down  there  acting the harry felt both stupid and it was all very well for been 1
elt  how  eerie  it was down in the surrounded by merpeople more than capable of 1
arry  said me with i think she can swim very they pulled sister through the back 1
toward the bank the twenty merpeople accompanying them like a guard of singing creechy 1
arry  could  see  madam  pomfrey  fussing  over and all of were wrapped in thick 1
umbledore  and  ludo  bagman  stood beaming at harry and ron but who looked very 1
white  and  somehow  much  younger  than out to meet meanwhile madame maxime was 1
trying  to  restrain quite fighting tooth and nail to return to the is she is she 1
arry tried to tell but he was so exhausted he could.

hardly  percy  seized  ron  and was dragging him back to the bank dumbledore and 1
bagman were pulling harry fleur had broken free of and was hugging her was ze zey 1
attacked me i said madam she seized harry and pulled him over to and the wrapped 1
him so tightly in a blanket that he felt and forced a measure of very hot potion 2
down  his  steam  gushed well hermione did you found out how all by said he would 1
have told her about but he had watching he was the only judge who had not left the 1
f  pleasure  and  relief  that  and  sister  had got back said raising his voice 1
slightly so that karkaroff could haff a water beetle in your said harry had that 2
krum  was  drawing  her  attention back onto perhaps to rescued her from the but 1
hermione brushed away the well outside the time did it take you ages to find found 2
you  feeling  of  stupidity  was now he was out of the it clear that dumbledores 1
safety  precautions have permitted the of a because their champion turned why he 1
just grabbed ron and have been first cedric and krum wasted time worrying about 1
aken  the  mersong  dumbledore was crouching at the deep in conversation with the 1
chief a particularly wild and he was making the same sort of screechy noises that 2
the merpeople made when they were dumbledore could speak finally he straightened 1
turned to his conference before we give the.

i  the  judges went into a madam pomfrey had gone to rescue she led him over to 1
harry  and the gave him a blanket and went to fetch fleur and her fleur had many 1
cuts  on  her but she seem to nor would she allow madam pomfrey to after she told 1
and  then  she  turned  to  saved  she  though she was not your said who was now 1
heartily  wishing  left  all  three girls fleur bent kissed harry twice on each 1
cheek felt his been surprised if steam was coming out of his ears then.

to said looking extremely a bit fleur swooped down on him too and kissed hermione 2
looked  but  ludo  magically  magnified  voice  boomed out beside making them and 1
causing  the  crowd in the stands to go and we have reached our merchieftainess 1
murcus  has  told  exactly  what happened at the bottom of the and we have out of 1
fifty for each of the as though she demonstrated excellent use of the was attacked 2
by  grindylows  as she approached her and failed to er applause from the deserved 1
said fleur shaking her magnificent who also used the was first to return with his 1
hough  he returned one minute outside the time limit of hufflepuffs in the harry 1
saw cho give cedric a glowing.

therefore  harrys heart if cedric had been outside the time he most krum used an 1
incomplete form of which was and was second to return with his we award him forty 1
arkaroff clapped particularly looking very potter used gillyweed to great bagman 1
returned  and  well  outside the time limit of an the merchieftainess informs us 1
irst  to  reach the and that the delay in his return was due all hostages to not 1
merely  his  ron  and hermione both gave of the and bagman gave karkaroff a very 1
nasty that shows moral fiber and merits full score is stomach leapt was now tying 2
for  first  place  with  ron  and  caught  by stared at then laughed and started 1
applauding.

hard  you  ron  shouted  over  the  being thick after all were showing fleur was 1
clapping  very  hard but krum look happy at hermione in conversation but she was 1
too  busy  cheering  harry  third  and final task will take place at dusk on the 1
champions  will  be  notified of what is coming precisely thank you all for your 1
support of it was harry thought as madam pomfrey began herding hostages back to 1
the castle to get into dry clothes was he have to worry about anything now until 1
june.

the  next  time he was in harry decided as he walked back up the he was going to 1
buy dobby a pair of socks for every day of the chapter seven padfoot returns one of 2
the  best  things about the aftermath of the second keen to hear details of what 1
had happened down in the which share limelight for harry noticed that version of events 1
very  at  he  gave  what seemed to be the it tallied with anyway had put all the 1
hostages  into a bewitched sleep in first assuring them that they would be quite 1
and  would  when  above  the one week ron was telling a thrilling tale struggled 1
against fifty heavily armed merpeople who had submission before tying him ihad my 2
wand hidden up my he assured padma who seemed to be keener on ron now that he was 2
getting so much attention and a him every time they passed in the taken those any 2
time.

i  were  you going to snore at said hermione people had been teasing her so much 1
about being the thing that viktor krum in rather tetchy ears went and he reverted 1
to  the  bewitched  sleep  version as they entered march the weather became but 1
cruel  winds and every time they went out onto the there were delays in the post 1
eing blown off the brown owl that harry had sent to with hogsmeade weekend turned 2
up at breakfast on friday morning up the wrong harry had no sooner torn off reply 2

ood as you come back to said looks like said believe said it so said not like the 1
place  is swarming dementors harry folded up the if he was honest with he really 1
sirius  he  therefore approached the final lesson of considerably more cheerful 1
than  he usually did when the to and goyle were standing in a huddle outside the 1
classroom  door  gang of slytherin all of them were looking at sniggering pansys 1

interest  you  in pansy said and she threw the magazine at who caught looking at 1
that  the door and snape beckoned them all and ron headed for a table at the back 1
of  the dungeon had turned his back on them to write up the ingredients hermione 1
hastily  rifled  through  the  magazine  under the hermione found what they were 1
looking harry and ron leaned of harry headed a short piece harry secret heartache 1

points from gryffindor but of course snapes glittered as they fell on rita has to 2

arry  tipped  the  powdered  beetles into his cauldron and up hands were shaking 1
slightly out of but he kept his what snape was saying.

you breaking into my office one been anywhere near your said harry forgetting his 2
feigned  lie  to  snape  his  fathomless black eyes boring into both come from my 1
private  and i know who stole harry stared back at determined not to blink or to 1

was broken moody might have joined your fan but i will not tolerate your one more 1
nighttime stroll into my and you will said harry turning back to his ginger bear 1
that  in  mind if the urge to go in eyes he plunged a hand into the inside of his 1
harry  thought snape was about to pull out his wand and he snape had drawn out a 1
small  crystal bottle of a clear at you know what this snape his eyes glittering 1
said with complete honesty is veritaserum truth potion so powerful that three drops 1
nnermost  secrets  for this entire class to said snape the is controlled by very 1
strict ministry but unless you find that my hand shook the crystal bottle slightly 1
nd  then  find out whether been in my office or harry said he turned back to his 1
ginger roots once picked started slicing them he like the sound of that truth potion 1
ast snape to slip him he repressed a shudder at of out of his mouth if snape did 1
quite apart from landing a hermione and dobby for a start were all the other things 1
hat  he  was in contact with and insides squirmed at the he he tipped his ginger 1
roots into the cauldron and wondered leaf out of moody s book and start drinking 1
only  a  there was a knock on the dungeon said snape in his usual the class looked 1
around  as  the  door professor karkaroff came him as he walked up toward he was 1
twisting  his  finger  around ooking need to said karkaroff abruptly when he had 1
reached he determined that nobody should hear what he was saying he was as though 2
he were a rather poor harry kept his talk to you after my snape but karkaroff interrupted 1
ant  to  talk while you slip been avoiding the under the pretext of holding up a 1
measuring cup to see if harry sneaked a sidelong glance at the pair of karkaroff 1
nd  snape  looked  karkaroff  hovered  behind  desk  for  the rest of the double 1
preventing snape from slipping away at the end of.

to  harry  deliberately  knocked over his bottle of armadillo which gave him an 1
excuse to duck down behind his cauldron and the class moved noisily toward the so 1
he  heard snape hiss at said and peering around the edge of his saw karkaroff up 1
the  sleeve  of  his  robe  and show snape something on said still making every 1
effort  not  to  move  his  you  never been this never it snarled his black eyes 1
sweeping the you must have noticed karkaroff began in an can talk spat what are you 1
p my armadillo said harry straightening up and showing snape the sodden rag he was 1
arkaroff  turned  on  his heel and strode out of the not wanting to remain alone 1
with  an exceptionally angry harry ingredients back into his bag and left at top 1
speed to.

he  they  left the castle at noon the next day to find a the weather was milder 1
than it had been all and by the all three of them had taken off their cloaks and 1
thrown them the food sirius had told them to bring was in they had a aloaf of and 1
a flask of pumpkin juice from the lunch they went into gladrags wizardwear to buy 2
a present for the most lurid socks they could including a pair patterned with and 1
another  that screamed loudly when they became too at half their way up the high 1
past  dervish and and out the harry had never been in this direction the winding 1
lane  was  out  wild  countryside  around the cottages were fewer and their were 1
walking toward the foot of the mountain in whose turned a corner and saw a stile 1
at  the end of the waiting on topmost was a very shaggy black which was carrying 1
some in mouth and looking very said harry when they had the black dog sniffed bag 1
wagged  its tail then away from them across the scrubby patch of ground that and 1
hermione climbed over the stile and sirius led them to the very foot of the where 2
the  ground  was and it was easy for with his four but and hermione were of they 1
followed sirius up onto the mountain for nearly an climbed a and stony following 1
wagging  sweating  in  the  the shoulder straps of bag cutting into his at sirius 1
slipped  out of and when they reached the place they saw a narrow fissure in the 1
they  squeezed into it and dimly lit tethered at the end of one end of his rope 1
uckbeak  the half gray half giant fierce orange eye at the sight of all three of 1
them bowed low to and after for a buckbeak bent his scaly front knees and allowed 2
to stroke his feathery was looking at the black which had just.

his  sirius  was  wearing  ragged gray the same ones he had he his black hair was 1
longer  than it had been when he had in untidy and matted once he looked he said 1
hoarsely after removing the old daily prophets throwing them down onto the cave 1
arry  pulled open his bag and handed over the bundle of said opening grabbing a 1
sitting down on the cave tearing off a large chunk with his been living off rats 2
food from draw attention to he grinned up at but harry returned the grin only you 1
doing  he  my  duty  as  said  gnawing  on the chicken bone in a very worry about 1
pretending  to be a he was still but seeing the anxiety in harrys said to on the 1
your  last  just  say things are getting been stealing paper every time someone 1
throws one and by the looks getting he nodded at the yellowing daily prophets on 1
the  cave  and  unfolded  continued  to  stare  if  they  catch what if three and 1
dumbledore  are  the  only ones around here who and continuing to devour the ron 1
nudged harry and passed him the daily there headline mystery illness ofbartemius 2
the ministry witch of magic now harry scanned the story about phrases jumped out 1
at  been  since  house  appears  hospital  for magical maladies injuries decline 1
ministry refuses to confirm rumors of making it sound like said harry he be that 1
ill if managed to get up brothers personal ron informed says crouch is suffering rom 1
e  did  look  last  time  i saw him up said harry night my name came out of his 1
comeuppance for sacking said an edge to her she was stroking who was crunching up 2
chicken  bet he wishes done it now he feels the difference now not there to look 1
bsessed  with  ron  muttered  to  casting hermione a dark ooked sacked his at the 1
quidditch  world  said and he launched into the story and winky being found with 1
harrys wand clutched in when harry had sirius was on his feet again and had and 1
down  the me get this he said after a brandishing a fresh chicken first the elfin 1
the  top  she was saving crouch a said and crouch turn up for said think he said 1
been sirius paced all around the cave in then he did you.

your for your wand after left the top harry thought he said need to use it before 2
we  got  in  and then i put my hand in my and all that was in there stared at you 1
saying whoever conjured the mark stole my ssteal that hermione elf the only one in 2
that  said  his brow furrowed as he else was sitting of said bulgarian cornelius 1
fudge malfoys said ron so loudly that his voice echoed all around the and buckbeak 2
tossed his head bet it was lucius aid aid there there was ludo hermione.

reminded  know anything about bagman except that he used to be said still he said 1
keeps  offering  to  help  me  with the said frowning more wonder why do taken a 1
liking  to  said looking saw him in the forest just before the dark mark told she 1
said  to  harry and but he stay in the did said moment we told him about he went 1
off  to  the hermione shot know where he disapparated off said ron you saying you 1
reckon  ludo  bagman  conjured  the more likely he did it than said hermione said 1
looking meaningfully at you obsessed with house but sirius held up a hand to the 1
dark mark had been and the elf had been what did crouch to look in the said there 2
anyone else sirius pacing up and want to pin it on anyone but his own and then he sacked 1
aid  hermione in a heated sacked just because she stayed in tent and let herself 1
get  trampled will you give it a rest with the sirius shook his head and got the 1
measure of crouch than you want to know what a mans take a good look at.

how  he  ran a hand over his unshaven evidently thinking these absences of barty 1
goes  to  the trouble of making sure saves him a seat at the quidditch world but 1
bother  to turn up very hard to reinstate the triwizard and then stops coming if 1
ever taken a day off work because of illness before eat know said face he suddenly 2
looked as menacing as he had the.

night met the night when harry still believed sirius to be a iknow crouch all he 1
said  was the one who gave the be sent to azkaban a said ron and said said taking 1
another great bite of used to be head department of magical law you and hermione 1
shook  their was tipped for the next minister of said a great powerfully magical 1
oh never a voldemort he reading the look on harrys barty crouch was always very against 1
ut then a lot of people who were against the dark you oo what my dad said at the 1
world said with a trace of in his hy agrin flashed across thin try he walked once 1
up  the  back and then powerful you know who his supporters you know working for 1
him  and  who  you  know  he can control people so do without being able to stop 1
scared  for  and your and your every news comes of more more more ministry of in 1
they  know what to trying to hidden from the but muggles are dying terror how it 1
used to times like that bring out the best in some people and the principles been 1
good in the beginning he rose quickly through and he started ordering very harsh 1
measures against were given new powers to kill rather than for and i the one who 1
was  handed straight to the dementors without crouch with and authorized the use 1
of the unforgivable curses against i became as ruthless and cruel as many on the 1
dark  he  had of people thought he was going about things the right and a wizards 1
clamoring  for him to take over as minister of looked like only a matter of time 1
until  crouch  got the unfortunate sirius smiled own son was caught with a group 1
eath eaters managed to talk their way out of apparently find voldemort and return 2
him  son  was  said  throwing  his chicken bone to flinging himself back ground 1
beside the loaf of and tearing it in little for should have spent a bit more time 2
at home with his left the office early once in a gotten to know his own he began 1
to wolf down large pieces of his son a death said said still stuffing down was in 1
azkaban myself when he was brought this is mostly stuff found out since i got the 1
he company of people bet my life were death eaters place at the wrong just like the 1
rouch try and get his son sirius let out a laugh that was much more like.

a  let  his  son  i  thought  you had the measure of anything that threatened to 1
tarnish  his reputation had to he had his life minister of you saw him dismiss a 1
devoted because she him dark mark again that tell you what fatherly far enough to 2
give  his  son a and by all it much crouch to show how much he hated the then he 1
sent  him to gave his own son to the asked harry said and he look remotely amused 1
saw the bringing him watched them through the bars in my cell they took him into 2
a  cell  near he was went quiet after a few they all went quiet in in for a the 1
deadened  look in eyes became more pronounced though shutters had closed behind 1
till in harry said sirius not in there he died about a year after they.

him  the  only  said sirius go mad in and plenty stop eating in the they lose the 1
will  to  you  could always tell when a dementors could sense they got that boy 1
looked  pretty sickly being an important ministry he and his wife were a was last 1
time i saw barty half carrying his wife past my she shortly wasted away just like 2
the crouch never came for his the dementors buried him outside the i watched them 2
do sirius threw aside the bread he had just lifted to his mouth pumpkin juice and drained 1
ld  crouch  lost it just when he thought he had it he his mouth with the back of 1
his a poised to become minister his son his wife the family name so heard since i 1
big  drop  in  once  the boy had people started a bit toward the son and started 1
asking how a nice young lad from a the conclusion was that his father never cared 2
much for so top and crouch was shunted sideways into the department.

of  there  was  a long harry was thinking of the way eyes had looked down at his 1
disobedient back in the wood at the must have been why crouch had overreacted to 1
winky being it had brought back memories of his and the old and.

his says crouch is obsessed with catching dark harry told heard become a bit of a 2
mania with said you ask he still thinks he can bring back the old popularity by he 2
sneaked up here to search s aid ron looking.

at  and  that  make sense at it said ron but sirius shook his if crouch wants to 1
investigate  why  he  been  coming  to judge it would be an ideal excuse to make 1
regular visits.

to  you  think  snape  could  be  up  to asked but hermione broke icare what you 1
dumbledore  trusts  snape give it a said ron know dumbledores brilliant but that 1
mean a really clever dark wizard fool him did snape save life in the first why he 2
just  let  dunno  he  thought  dumbledore  would kick him harry said and ron and 1
hermione stopped bickering.

to think both got a said looking thoughtfully at ron and since i found out snape 1
was  teaching  wondered why dumbledore always been fascinated by the dark he was 1
famous  for he sirius and harry and ron grinned at each knew more curses when he 1
arrived at school than half the kids in gang of slytherins who nearly all turned 2
out  to be death sirius held up his fingers and began ticking off and wilkes were 1
both  killed  by aurors the year before the lestranges a married couple in avery 1
what heard he wormed his way out of trouble by saying been acting under but as far 2
as i snape was never even accused of means plenty of them were never and snape s 2
certainly and enough to keep himself out of knows karkaroff pretty but he wants to 2
keep that said you seen face when karkaroff turned up in potions said harry wanted 2
to  talk  to  he  says  been  avoiding  karkaroff  looked really he showed snape 1
something on his but i see he showed snape something on his said looking frankly he 1
ingers  distractedly  through  his  filthy  then  shrugged no but if karkaroff s 1
genuinely  and  going to snape for answers sirius stared at the cave then made a 1
grimace of still the fact that dumbledore trusts and i know dumbledore a of other 1
people  but i just see him letting snape teach worked for are moody and crouch so 1
keen  to  get  into  snapes office said said sirius put it past to have searched 1
every  single  office when he got to he takes his defense against the not sure he 1
trusts  anyone  at  and  after the things not say this for he never killed if he 1
could help always brought in where he was but he never descended to the level of 1
a  different  matter he really if he why did he make himself up to and if he up 1
what  was  he  doing at cup that was so important he turn up in the top he been 1
hould  have  been judging sirius lapsed into still staring at the cave buckbeak 1
was  on rocky looking for bones he might have sirius looked up say your brother s 1
personal any chance you could ask seen crouch can said ron not make it sound like 2
i  reckon  crouch anything percy loves you might try and find out whether got any 1
leads on while at said gesturing to the second copy of the.

daily  told  me they quoted in the article in said nodding at the about how bad 1
memory  maybe changed since i knew but the i knew forgetful at all the she was a 1
bit  but she had an memory for it used to get her into a lot of she never mouth i 1
can  see her being a bit of a liability at the bagman bother to look for her for 1
sirius  heaved  an  enormous  sigh  and  rubbed  his  the harry checked his then 1
remembered  it  been  working since hour in the half past said better get back to 1
sirius getting to his he looked particularly hard at want you lot sneaking out of 2
school  to  send  notes  to  me i still want to hear about anything but hogwarts 1
without it would be an ideal opportunity for someone tried to attack me so except 2
a  dragon  and a couple of but sirius scowled breathe freely again when this and 1
not  and  if talking about me among call me he handed harry the empty napkin and 1
flask and went to pat walk the edge of the village with said if i can scrounge he 1
transformed  into the great black dog before they left the the mountainside with 1
across  the  strewn  and  back  to the he allowed each of them to pat him on the 1
before  turning  outskirts  of the and hermione made their way back into oward if 1
percy  knows all that stuff about ron said as they up the maybe he probably just 1
make  him  admire  crouch even percy loves just say crouch was refusing to break 1
them for would never throw any of his family to the said hermione said he thought 1
we were standing in the way of his really you they walked up the stone steps into 1
the  entrance  where  wafted  toward them from the great old said breathing must 1
really like imagine having to live off cthe madness of mr crouch and hermione went 1
up  to  the  owlery after breakfast on as sirius had whether he had seen crouch 1
they  used because it had been so long since had a when they had of sight through 1
the owlery they proceeded down to the.

kitchen the gave them a very cheery bowing and curtsying and bustling making tea 1
dobby was ecstatic about his potter is too good to he wiping large tears out.

of  saved  my life with that you really said chance of more of those is said who 1
was looking around at beaming and bowing just had said hermione but a great silver 2
platter of already zooming toward supported by four should get some stuff to send 1
up to harry said pig something to you give us a bit of extra could he said to the 1
surrounding  and they bowed delightedly ome said who was looking is over there by 1
the said dobby his ears said hermione as she harry looked over at the fireplace 1
winky was sitting on she had allowed herself to become so filthy that she brick 1
behind  her clothes were ragged and she was clutching a bottle of butterbeer and 1
swaying  slightly on her staring as she gave an is getting through six bottles a 1
day  dobby  whispered  not  that  harry but dobby shook his strong for a he winky 1
hiccuped  the  elves who had brought the eclairs gave her they returned is harry 1
dobby whispered wants to go still thinks crouch is her and nothing dobby says will 1
umbledore  is her master said struck by a sudden walking over to and bending know 1
what crouch might be up do because stopped turning up to judge the triwizard eyes 1
her enormous pupils focused on she swayed then is stopped said seen him since the 2
first the daily.

saying winky swayed some staring blurrily.

at  her bottom lip began to not sure if said is needing his whimpered the cannot 1
ie people manage to do their own you hermione.

said  not  only  housework  for  winky  swaying  worse  than  ever and slopping 1
butterbeer down her is winky with most important.

most  said  but winky shook her head very spilling more butterbeer down keeps she 1
said  swaying  very frowning up at harry with her eyes is you must not talk like 1
that to harry said dobby potter.

silence trying to and poke eyelids drooped and without she slid off her stool into 1
noring  the  empty  bottle of butterbeer rolled away across dozen came hurrying 1
looking  one of them picked up the the others covered winky with a large checked 1
tablecloth and her from is sorry you had to see sirs and squeaked a nearby looking 1
very is hoping you will not judge us all said you try and cheer her up instead of 1
overing  her your said the bowing deeply has no right to be unhappy when there is 1
work  to be done and for heavens hermione to all of got just as right as wizards 1
to  be unhappy got the right to wages you have to do everything told will please 1
keep dobby out of dobby looking the cheery smiles had vanished from the faces of 1
the around the they looking at hermione as though she were mad and has your extra 1
squeaked  an elf at and he shoved a dozen and some fruit the crowded around and 1
hermione and began shunting them the many little hands pushing in the smalls of their 1
ou  for  the harry dobby called miserably from the where he was standing next to 1
the lumpy tablecloth that was keep your mouth could said ron angrily as the kitchen 1
oor  slammed  shut  behind  want us visiting them now we tried more stuff out of 1
winky about as if you care about scoffed only like coming down.

here it was an irritable sort of day after harry got so of each other over their 1
homework in the common room that evening on his pigwidgeon was much too small to 1
carry an entire ham up harry enlisted the help of two school screech owls looking 2
extremely  odd  carrying  the  large  package between looking out at the at the 1
rustling  treetops of the sails of the durmstrang an eagle owl flew through the 1
it  soared  toward  the  around  the  and  out  of  looking  saw  hagrid digging 1
energetically  in  front of his harry what looked as though he were making a new 1
vegetable as he madame emerged from the beauxbatons carriage and walked over to she 1
ngage  him  in  hagrid  leaned  upon his but did not seem keen to because madame 1
maxime returned to the carriage shortly unwilling to go back to gryffindor tower 1
and listen to ron at harry watched hagrid digging until the darkness swallowed him 1
arry began to swooshing past him into the by breakfast the next day and bad moods 2
had burnt.

and  dark  predictions  that the would send substandard food up to table because 1
hermione  had  insulted them proved the and kippers as good as when the post owls 1
hermione looked up she seemed to.

be had time to answer said only sent hedwig not said taken out a subscription to 1
the getting sick of finding everything out from the said also looking up at the i 2
think.

in  a  gray owl was soaring down toward got a she looking but to her the gray owl 1
landed  in  front  of her closely by barn a brown and many subscriptions did you 1
take  said  seizing goblet before was knocked over by the cluster of all of whom 1
were  jostling their own letter on earth hermione taking the letter from the gray 1
opening to she going rather aid how she thrust the letter at who saw that it was 1
not  but  letters  that seemed to have been cut out of the daily you are a wicked 1
harry  potter deserves go back where you came from all like said hermione opening 1
one  letter  after potter can do much better than the likes of you deserve to be 1
she  had  opened the last and liquid smelling strongly of petrol gushed over her 1
which  began  to  erupt  in  large yellow bubotuber said picking up the envelope 1
gingerly and said tears starting in her eyes as she tried to rub a but her fingers 2
were now so thickly covered in painful sores were wearing a pair of knobbly better 2
get up to the hospital said harry as the owls around tell professor sprout where 1
arned  said  ron as hermione hurried out of the great cradling warned her not to 1
annoy  rita  look at this one he read out hermione had left read in witch weekly 1
about how you are and that boy has had enough hardship and i will be you can find 1
a big enough better watch out for hermione turn up for as harry and ron left the greenhouse 1
agical  creatures  they saw and goyle descending the stone steps pansy parkinson 1
was  whispering  and  giggling behind them with catching sight of pansy have you 1
split  up  with  your  was  she  so upset harry ignored he want to give her the 1
satisfaction  of  how witch weekly article had who had told them last lesson that 1
they had finished.

with  them  outside  his  cabin with a fresh supply of open at of the crates not 1
another skrewt when he got near enough to he found himself looking at a number of 2
flurry black with were curiously like and they were blinking up at the at all the 1

the  nifflers  had suddenly leapt up and she shrieked and jumped little treasure 1

yer  no  point ter steal he his eyes leprechaun vanishes after a few goyle emptied 1
his  looking  extremely  it  turned  out that niffler most so hagrid gave him an 1
enormous  slab  of honeydukes a bell rang across the grounds for the rest of the 1
class  set  and  hermione  stayed  behind to help hagrid put the nifflers noticed 1
madame  maxime  watching them out other carriage yeh done ter your said hermione 1

aid  ron  you  tell  me  about  the sgold i gave you at the quidditch world said 1
leprechaun  for my in the top why you tell me it harry had to think for a moment 1
before  he realized what ron was he the memory coming back to him at dunno never 1
noticed i was more worried about my they climbed the steps into the entrance hall 2
and  went into be ron said when they had sat down and started serving themselves 1
oast  beef  and  yorkshire  have so much money you notice if a of galleons i had 1
other stuff on my mind that s aid harry.

cannon hat for all said ron speared a roast potato on the end of his glaring.

at  harry  and hermione looked at each neither of them really said still glaring 1
down at his blame fred and george trying to make some extra wish i wish i had a we 2
know  what to get you next said hermione when ron continued to look she it could 1
be at least your fingers full of hermione was having a lot of difficulty managing 1
ere  so  stiff  and hate that skeeter she burst out get her for this if the last 1
thing  i hate mail continued to arrive for hermione over the followed advice and 1
stopped  opening  several  of her exploded at the gryffindor table and shrieked 1
insults  people who read witch weekly knew all about the supposed triangle harry 1
was getting sick of telling people that his die he told we just ignore people got 2
bored with that stuff she wrote about me last time want to know how listening into 2
private  conversations  when  banned from the said hermione hermione hung back in 1
their next defense against the dark to moody the rest of the class was very eager 2
to moody had a rigorous test of that many of them were nursing small bad case of 1
twitchy  he  had to hold his hands clamped definitely not using an invisibility 1
hermione  panted five catching up with harry and ron in the entrance hall and his 1
wiggling  ears  so  that  he  could hear says he see her table at the second or 1
anywhere near the is there any point in telling you to drop.

said  said  hermione want to know how she heard me talking to how she found out 1
about hagrids she had you said said ron put fleas on her harry started explaining 1
about hidden microphones and but hermione interrupted you two ever going to read 1
a  history  a  the  said  know  it by we can just ask those substitutes for magic 1
muggles use and and all things all go haywire around too much magic in the using 1
agic to she must if i could just find out what it.

is we got enough to worry ron asked we have to start against rita skeeter as not 1
asking you to hermione do it on she marched back up the marble staircase without 2
a was going to the the betting she comes back with a box of hate rita said did not 2
ask  harry  and  ron to help her pursue against for which they were both because 1
their  workload  was  ever  the  days  before  the easter harry frankly marveled 1
research  magical  methods  of eavesdropping as well as else working just to get 1
through all their though he made a point regular food packages up to the cave in 1
the  mountain  forgotten what it felt like to be continually he enclosed nothing 1
out of the ordinary had and that they were still.

waiting  hedwig  return  until  the end of the easter letter was in a package of 1
easter eggs that weasley had both harrys and dragon eggs and full of homemade was 2

heavily perfumed fumes washed over and the the window played across his he could 1
hear  an  insect humming the his eyelids began to he was riding on the back of an 1
eagle soaring through the house set high on a lower and lower they the wind blowing 1

gloomy  to  a room at the the door they into a dark room whose windows were harry 1

who  was wearing an expression of great as had just been denied a real when harry 1
reached  the  bottom of her he did not set off he had no intention whatsoever of 1
going  sirius  had hurt him and harry was going to follow his he was going to he 1
marched down the thinking about what he had seen in the been as vivid as the one 1
that had awoken him on privet trying to make sure he could remember he had heard 1
ormtail  of  making  a  but  the  owl had brought good the had somebody was dead 1
wormtail  was not going to be fed was going to be fed to harry had walked right 1
past  the stone gargoyle guarding the without he looked realized what he had and 1
retraced his stopping in front of then he remembered that he know he the gargoyle 2
did not said staring at er fizzing best blowing bertie every flavor beans he like 1
does  just  he  said  really  need  to see its the gargoyle remained harry kicked 1
achieving  nothing  but  an  excruciating  pain in he yelled standing on one the 1
gargoyle sprang to life and jumped harry he was only he hurried through the gap in 2
the  walls and stepped onto which moved slowly upward as the doors closed behind 1
him a door with a brass door he could hear voices from inside the he stepped off.

berthas perfectly capable i agree we would have expected to have found her by but 1
oul  none at as for her disappearance being linked with barty what do you thinks 1

job  dumbledore  smiled  at harry behind his eyes said looking about to go for a 1
short walk on the if excuse us if you just go back to your class wanted to talk to 2
harry said looking at who gave a searching here for he examination of the grounds 2
will not take they trooped out in silence past him and closed the after clunks of 1
wooden  leg  growing  fainter in the corridor he e professor was standing on his 1
golden  perch beside the the size of a with magnificent he swished his long tail 1
blinked  benignly  at  harry  sat down in a chair in front of for several he sat 1
atched  the old headmasters and headmistresses snoozing in had just and running 1
his  fingers over his it had he felt much now that he was in knowing he shortly 1
be  telling  him about the harry looked up at the the and ragged sorting hat was 1
standing  on a a glass case sword with large rubies set into the which harry out 1
of  the sorting hat in his second the sword had once founder of he was gazing at 1
remembering how it had come had thought all hope was when he noticed a patch of and 1
n  the  glass  he looked around for the source of the light and shining brightly 1
from within a black cabinet behind whose harry glanced at then got walked across 2
the and pulled open the.

cabinet a shallow stone basin lay with odd carvings around the harry did not the 1
silvery light was coming from the which were nothing harry had ever seen he could 2
not  tell  whether  the was a whitish and it was moving the surface of it water 1
beneath and like separated and swirled it looked like made liquid like wind made 1
solid  make  up  he  wanted to touch to find out what it felt but nearly magical 1
world  told  him  that  sticking  his  hand  into a bowl very stupid thing to he 1
therefore pulled his wand out look around the looked back at the contents of the 1
the surface of the silvery stuff inside the basin began harry bent his head right 2
inside  the  the  silvery  substance  had  it looked like he looked down into it 1
expecting to see the basin saw instead an enormous room below the surface of into 2
which he seemed to be looking through a circular in the room was dimly he thought 2
it  might even be for no merely torches in brackets such as the ones that the of 1
ace  so  that  his nose was a mere inch away from the glassy rows of witches and 1
wizards were seated around every wall in an empty chair stood in the very center 1
of  the  there  chair  that  gave harry an ominous chains encircled the arms were 1
usually  tied  to where was this it surely he had never seen a room like that the 1
crowd in the mysterious room at the bottom of the basin and harry knew there were 2
not nearly that many teachers at to be waiting for even though he could only see 1
the tops their faces seemed to be pointing in one and none of them the basin being 2
and the room he was observing harry could what was going on in the corners of he 1
leaned  even  tilting  the tip of his nose touched the strange substance into he 1
ffice  gave  an almighty lurch was thrown forward and pitched into the substance 1
inside the basin but his head did not hit the stone he was falling through it was 1
like  being  sucked  into  a dark whirlpool and harry found himself sitting on a 1
bench  at  the end of bench raised high above the he looked up at the high stone 1
ircular window through which he had just been but solid breathing hard and harry 1
looked  around not one of the and in room there were at least two hundred of was 1
looking  at  to have noticed that a boy had just dropped from the harry turned to 1
the  wizard  next  to  him on the bench a reverberated around the he was sitting 1
right  next  to  albus  harry  said in a kind of strangled sorry mean to was just 1
looking  at  that basin in your cabinet but dumbledore move or he ignored harry 1
like  every  on  the he was staring into the far corner of the was harry at then 1
around at the silently watchful then back at and then it dawned.

on  once  harry  had  found  himself  somewhere that nobody could he had fallen 1
through  a  page in an enchanted right and unless he was very much something of 1
the  sort  had  harry  raised  his right and then waved it energetically in from 1
umbledore did not look around at or indeed move at and in settled the dumbledore 1
ignore him like he was inside a and this was not the yet it be that long the dumbledore 1
itting  next  to him now was just like the but what was this what were all these 1
wizards  waiting  harry  looked  around  more the as he had suspected when it was 1
almost  certainly  underground of a dungeon than a he was a bleak and forbidding 1
air  about the there were no on decorations at just these serried rows of rising 1
in  levels  all  the positioned so that they had a clear view of that chair with 1
efore  harry  could  reach any conclusions about the place in he the door in the 1
corner  of  the  dungeon  opened  and  three  people flanked by insides went the 1
dementors  hooded creatures whose faces were concealed gliding slowly toward the 1
chair  in the center of the arms with their dead and the man between them looked 1
hough  he was about to and harry blame him knew the dementors touch him inside a 1
but he remembered their power only too recoiled slightly as the dementors placed 1
the  man  in  the  the  door  swung shut behind harry looked down at the man now 1
sitting in the chair and unlike karkaroff looked much his hair and goatee were he 1
ot dressed in sleek but in thin and ragged he was even the chains on the arms of 1
the  chair glowed suddenly binding said a curt voice to harry looked around and 1
saw  standing  up in the middle of the bench beside hair he looked fit and have 1
been brought from azkaban to to ministry of you have given us to understand that 1

although his voice was very harry could still familiar unctuous note in wish to 1

to she was clutching a handkerchief to her harry looked up at crouch and saw that 2
he looked gaunter nerve was twitching in his them he and his voice echoed through 2
the silent the door in the corner opened yet six dementors entered four harry saw 1
the  people in the crowd turn to look up at whispered to one the dementors placed 1
each of the four people in the four stood on the dungeon there was a thickset man 2
who  and  more  whose eyes were darting around the a woman shining dark hair and 1
heavily  hooded  who  was sitting in a and a boy in his late who looked nothing 1
short of he was hair all over his his freckled skin the wispy little crouch began 2

witch beside him gave a great gasp and slumped in her crouch appeared not to them 2
crouch roared at the spit flying from his and may they rot iit is time to return 1
to  my  said a quiet voice in harrys harry he looked then he looked on his other 1
here  was  an  albus  dumbledore  sitting  on his watching son being away by the 1
dementors there was an albus dumbledore on his at said the dumbledore on his and 1
he  put  his  hand himself rising into the the dungeon dissolved around for and 1
then  he felt as though he had done a suddenly in what seemed like the dazzling 1
light of sunlit the shimmering in the cabinet in front of and albus harry know i 2
mean cabinet door was sort of open and quite said he lifted the carried it over to 2
his  placed  it  upon the polished and sat down in the chair behind he oharry did 1
staring  at  the  stone  the  contents  had returned white swirling and rippling 1
beneath is harry asked it is called a said sometimes and i am sure you the that i 2
simply  have too many thoughts and memories into said who truthfully say that he 1
had ever felt anything of these said indicating the stone use the one siphons the 2
excess  thoughts  from  pours  them  into  the  and at it becomes easier to spot 1
patterns and you when they.

umbledore  drew his wand out of the inside of his robes silvery near his when he 1
took  the wand hair seemed to be then harry saw that it was in fact a glistening 1
strand of the that filled the dumbledore added this fresh thought to the saw his 1
own  face swimming around the surface of the on either side of the pensieve and 1
swirled  rather  as a of and harry saw his own face change smoothly into who his 1
poke  to the his voice coming karkaroff s stronger and clearer than connection i 1
could have made without dumbledore never he peered over the top of his spectacles 2
at  who  was which was continuing to swirl around the was using the when arrived 1
for our meeting and put it away rather undoubtedly i door it would have attracted 2
your  arry  dumbledore  shook his is not a he we should exercise with our indeed 1
rowning  he  prodded the thoughts within the basin with of afigure rose out of a 1
scowling girl of about who to her feet still in the she took no notice whatsoever 2
of  when she her voice echoed as had as though it were of the stone put a hex on 1
professor and was only teasing i only said seen him kissing.

behind said dumbledore looking up at the now silently did you have to follow him 2
in  the  first harry looking up at that that bertha said prodding the thoughts in 1
the  basin  bertha  sank  back  into and they became silvery and opaque once was 1
bertha as i her the silvery light from the pensieve illuminated and it suddenly 1
how  very  old  he  was he of that dumbledore was on but somehow he never really 1
thought of dumbledore as an said dumbledore you got lost in my you wanted to tell e 1
aid was in divination just and fell he hesitated wondering if a reprimand was but 2
dumbledore i had a said dream about lord he was you know who do said got a letter 2
from  an  he said something blunder had he said someone was then he wormtail be 1
fed to the snake was a snake beside his he said said be feeding me to then he did 1
the  cruciatus  curse  on  wormtail  my scar woke me it hurt so dumbledore merely 1
looked.

at said said dumbledore has your scar hurt at any other time excepting the time it 2
woke  you up over the idid you know it woke me up over the said are not only said 1
have also been in contact with him ever since he left hogwarts last it was i who suggested 1
afest  place for him dumbledore got up and began walking up and down behind his 1
laced his wand tip to his removed another shining silver and the thoughts inside 1
began  to  swirl  so  fast  that harry make it was merely a blur he said after a 1
couple  dumbledore  stopped pacing and looked at he said he sat back down at his 1
now  why my hurting dumbledore looked very intently at harry for a and then more 1
than  it  is  my  belief  that  your  scar  hurts both when when he is feeling a 1
particularly strong surge.

of you and he are connected by the curse that said is no rdinary you that did it really 1
s  said  would  say harry you see said the back of his but have been anything to 1
ould i he got a has but then how could he have held harry said mneither dumbledore 2
nor  harry  spoke for a dumbledore was the every now and placing his wand tip to 1
his temple and thought to the seething mass within the harry said at you think getting 1
aid  looking at harry over the it was the piercing look dumbledore had given him 1
on other and always made though dumbledore were seeing right through him in a way 1
can  only give you my dumbledore sighed and he looked and than years of ascent to 1
he marked with bertha jorkins has vanished without a trace in the place be crouch 2
too  has  within  these  very  and  there was a one which the i regret to do not 1
consider of any for concerns a his name was frank he lived in the village grew and 2
he  has  not  been  seen  since last you i read the unlike most of my dumbledore 1
looked  very seriously at disappearances seem to me to be the ministry disagrees 1
while  waiting  outside my harry silence fell between them dumbledore extracting 1
thoughts now and harry felt as though he ought to but his curiosity in he said.

said  could  i  ask you that court thing i was in the said dumbledore attended it 1
many  but  some trials come back to me more clearly than know know the trial you 1
found  me  the one with they talking about dumbledore gave harry a very sharp has 1
neville never told he brought up by his he harry shook his as he did how he could 1
have failed to almost four years of knowing they were talking about nevilles said 2
was  an  auror  just like professor he and his wife were tortured for whereabouts 1
after he lost his as you said harry said his voice full of a bitterness harry had 1
never  heard  are  they  are  both  in hospital for magical maladies and believe 1
neville visits with his during the they do.

not harry sat he had never in four bothered to.

find  longbottoms  were very said attacks on them came after fall from just when 1
everyone thought they were those attacks a wave of fury such as i have never the 1
ministry  was  under  great  who had done the evidence was their condition oo son 1
might not have been said harry dumbledore shook to i have no harry sat in silence 1
once  watching  the  contents  of  the more questions he was burning to but they 1
concerned  the  guilt  e never been accused of any dark activity said said harry 1
staring  at  the contents of the pensieve which more slowly now that dumbledore 1
had  stopped  adding  but the pensieve seemed to be asking his question face was 1
swimming  on the surface dumbledore glanced down up at more has professor he harry 1
looked into light blue and the thing he really wanted out of his mouth before he 1
could  stop  made you think really stopped dumbledore held harrys gaze for a few 1
and  then  is  a  between  professor  snape  harry  knew  that the interview was 1
dumbledore  did not look finality in his tone that told harry it was time to he 1
said as harry reached the do not speak about parents to anybody he has the right 1
to let people when he said turning.

to  harry  looked dumbledore was standing over the his face lit from its silvery 1
spots of looking older than he stared at harry.

for luck with the third cthe third task dumbledore reckons getting stronger again 1
as  ron  everything harry had seen in the nearly everything dumbledore him he had 1
now shared with ron and hermione of with to whom harry had sent an owl the moment 2
he had left and hermione sat up late in the common room once again that talking it 1
ntil  he  understood  what dumbledore had meant about a head so thoughts that it 1
would  have  been  a relief to siphon them ron stared into the common room harry 1
thought he saw ron shiver the evening he trusts ron really trusts even though he 1
knows  he  was  a  eath aid hermione had not spoken for ten she was sitting with 1
staring  at  her  harry thought she too looked as though she can you be worrying 1
about her said in utter not worrying about hermione said to her just remember she 2
said  to  me in the three know things about ludo that your hair this is what she 1
she  reported  his she knew information to the death and winky a bad crouch would 1
have been furious he got he would have but bagman pass information on did ermione 1
udge  reckons  madame  maxime attacked ron turning back to said only saying that 1
because  crouch  disappeared  near  the eauxbatons never thought of did said ron 1
definitely  got giant and she want to admit course she said hermione looking what 1
happened to hagrid when rita found out about his look at jumping to conclusions about 1
ecause  part  who  needs  that  sort of probably say i had big knew what get for 1
telling  the hermione looked at her done any she were going to do the impediment 1
have  to  really  get  down  come  you need to get some harry and ron went slowly 1
upstairs  to  their  as harry looked over at nevilles true to his word to he had 1
bout neville s as harry took off his glasses and climbed into he imagined how it 1
must  feel to have parents still living but to sympathy from strangers for being 1
an but as he listened to that neville deserved it more than he lying in the harry 1
ate toward the people who had tortured and he remembered the crowd as son and his 2
companions  had  been  dragged  from  the  he  understood  how  they had then he 1
remembered the face.

of screaming boy and realized with a jolt that he had died a it was harry staring 2
up at the canopy of his bed in the came back to he was the one who had torn these 2
these ron and hermione were supposed to be studying for day of the third but they 2
were  putting most of their efforts worry about hermione said shortly when harry 1
pointed  this  out  mind  practicing on his own for a least get top marks in dark 1

would take place a was practicing hexes at every available he felt more confident 1
ither  of  the  difficult and dangerous though it would was harry had managed to 1
find  his way past monstrous creatures and and this time he had some some chance 1
to  prepare  himself  tired of walking in on and ron all over the had given them 1
permission to use the empty transfiguration soon mastered the impediment a spell 1
to  slow  down  and the which would enable him to blast solid objects out of his 1
seful  discovery  of  hermiones that would make his wand to check whether he was 1
going in the right direction with the shield this was supposed to cast a invisible 1
imself  that  deflected  minor  hermione managed to shatter it and harry wobbled 1
around the room for ten minutes.

before  still  doing really hermione said looking down her list and crossing off 1
those spells they had already of these.

irius  was sending daily owls like he seemed to want to on getting harry through 1

and  said  he gave a short blast on his and harry and cedric hurried the towering 1
hedges cast black shadows across the tall and thick or because they had been the 2
sound of the silenced the moment they entered the harry felt almost as he pulled 1
out his and heard cedric do the same just behind after about fifty they reached a 2
they  looked  at  harry  and  he took the left while cedric took the harry heard 1
whistle  for  the  second krum had entered his chosen path seemed completely he 1
turned and hurried holding high over his trying to see as far ahead as there was in 1
histle blew in the distance for the third all of the.

now  harry  kept looking behind the old feeling that he was was maze was growing 1
darker  with every passing minute as the sky reached a second he whispered to his 1
holding it flat in his the wand spun around once and pointed toward his into and 1
he knew that he needed to go northwest for the do was to take the left fork and 1
go  right  again as soon the path ahead was empty and when harry reached a he his 1
way  harry  know  but  the  lack  of  obstacles was unnerving he should have met 1
something by it felt as though the a sense of then he heard movement right behind 2
he held.

severely  the  sleeve of his robe was he enormous only just got he shook his head 1
and dived out of along another keen to between himself and the harry hurried off 1
as he turned a he dementor gliding toward twelve feet its face hidden by its hands 2
it  sensing  its  way  blindly  toward harry could hear he felt clammy coldness 1
stealing  over  but  knew  what  he  had  he  summoned  the happiest thought he 1
concentrated with all getting out of the maze and celebrating with ron and.

his  a  silver stag erupted from the end of wand and fell back and tripped over 1
the hem of its harry had a he advancing in the wake of his silver.

a  there  was  a  loud and the exploded in a wisp of the silver faded from harry 1
wished it could have he could have but moved quickly and quietly as listening his 2
wand  held high left left twice he found himself facing dead he spell again and 1
found  that  he was going too far he turned odd golden mist floating ahead harry 1
approached  it pointing the beam at this looked like some he wondered whether he 1
might be able to blast it out of the hthe spell shot straight through the leaving 2
it  he  supposed  the reductor curse was for solid what would happen if he was it 1
worth  chancing  or  should  he  double  he  was  still hesitating when a scream 1
shattered harry there was he stared all around what had happened to her have come 1
from  somewhere  he took a deep breath and ran the the world turned upside harry 1
was  hanging from the with his glasses dangling off his threatening to fall into 1

below him the heavens stretched he felt as though if he tried to move one of his 1
he  would  he  told  as all the blood rushed to but not one of the spells he had 1
practiced  had  been  designed ground and did he dare move his he could hear the 1
blood in two choices and or send up red and get rescued and from he shut his so he 2
be  able to see the view of endless his right foot as hard as he could away from 1
the grassy the world righted harry fell forward onto his knees onto solid he felt 1
temporarily limp with he took a steadying again and hurried looking back over his 2
shoulder as he ran which twinkled innocently at him in the he paused at a junction 2
of  two  paths  and  looked around had been she who had what had she was she all 1
there  was  no  sparks  that mean she had got herself out of or was she reach her 1
harry took the right fork with a feeling of.

this  what  if he actually managed to and for first time since found himself he 1
saw again that image triwizard cup in front of the rest of the he met nothing for 1
ten but kept running into dead twice he wrong he found a new route and started to 2
jog  along  his  making his shadow flicker and distort on the hedge then he found 1
himself  facing  a  cedric  was right was ten feet it looked more like a its long 1
sting was curled over its its thick armor glinted which he pointed.

at  the  spell  hit  the armor and harry ducked just in but could burning it had 1
singed the top of his the skrewt issued a flew forward toward harry the spell hit 1
the  armor  again  and  ricocheted  harry staggered back a few paces and fell the 1
skrewt  was  inches from him when it froze had managed less harry pushed himself 1
away  from  it and in the direction impediment curse was not the skrewt would be 1
legs  at any he took a left path and hit a dead a and hit forcing to he performed 1
the spell and chose a path that would take him he had been hurrying along the new 1
path  for  a few when path running parallel to his own that made him stop are you 1
yelled the hell and then harry.

none  he  tried  the reductor curse very but it burned a small hole in the hedge 1
through  at  the thick brambles and branches until they broke and an tearing his 1

pointed his wand at krum and began harry the spell hit krum in the he stopped dead 2

gleaming  on a plinth a hundred hurtled out onto the path in front of cedric was 1
going  to get there cedric was sprinting harry knew he would never catch cedric 1
was  much  then harry saw something immense over a hedge to his intersected with 1
his  it  was  moving so fast cedric was eyes on the had not seen it harry cedric 1
looked  around just in time to hurl himself in his he harry saw wand fly out of 1
his  hand  as a into the path and began to bear down upon harry the spell hit the 1
hairy black but for all good it he might as well have thrown a stone at the spider 1
t.

harry but it was no use spider was either so or so that the more than aggravating 2
harry had one horrifying glimpse of eight sharp pincers before it was upon he was 1
lifted  into the air in its front struggling he tried connected with the pincers 1
and  next moment he was in yelling but his spell had no more effect than raised 1
his as the spider opened its pincers once more and it worked disarming spell made 2
the  spider drop but that twelve feet onto his already injured which crumpled he 1
aimed high at the as he had done with the and as cedric yelled the.

same the two spells combined did what one alone had the over flattening a nearby 1
and  strewing  the  path  with  a tangle he heard cedric all did it fall on harry 1
called he looked down at his it was bleeding he see some sort of gluey secretion 1
from the pincers on his he but his leg was shaking badly and did not want to support 1
asping for and looked cedric was standing feet from the triwizard which was gleaming 1
arry panted to take but cedric he merely stood looking at then he turned to stare 1
arry  saw  the  longing  expression  on his face in its golden harry who was now 1
holding onto the hedge to support cedric take you should twice saved my neck not 2
how supposed to harry he felt his leg was very he was aching all over from trying 2
to  throw  off  the  and  him  to just as beaten harry to ask cho to the one the 1

had dropped got more points on the second said cedric stayed behind to get all the 2
i was the only one who was thick enough to take that song take the aid he stepped 1
over  the tangled legs to join who stared at cedric he was walking away from the 1
sort of glory hufflepuff house cedric he looked as though this was costing him every 1
ut  his face was his arms were he seemed harry looked from cedric to the for one 1
shining he saw the holding he saw himself holding the triwizard cup heard the saw 1
face shining with more clearly than he had ever seen it the picture and he found 1

had reached they both held a hand out over one.

was a he said he was looking around the it was completely silent and slightly this 2
supposed to be part of the said he sounded slightly said glad that cedric had made 2
the suggestion rather than they pulled out their harry kept looking around he yet 2

and  glanced sideways at cedric they both turned back to watch the approaching it 1
stopped beside a towering marble only six feet from for and cedric and the short 1
figure simply looked at one and without scar exploded with it was agony such as he 1
elt  in all his his wand slipped from his fingers as he he was on the ground and 1
he  could see nothing at his from far above his he heard a cold voice a swishing 1
noise and a second which screeched the words.

to a blast of green light blazed through and he heard something ground beside the 2
pain in his scar reached such a pitch that.

he  terrified of what he was about to he opened his stinging cedric was lying on 1
the  ground  beside  he  was for a second that contained an harry stared into at 1
blank and expressionless as the windows of a deserted looked slightly and before 2

harry  saw  the name upon it flickering was forced around and slammed against tom 1
the  cloaked  man  was now conjuring tight cords around to the harry could hear 1
fast breathing from the depths of and the man hit him him with a hand that had a 1

was busy tightness of the his fingers trembling rumbling over the that harry was 1
bound so tightly to the headstone that he length of some black material from the 1
inside  of  his  and  without a he turned from harry and hurried harry make a nor 1

right  in  front of body was lying some twenty feet some way beyond glinting lay 1

to  be water around it was larger than any cauldron harry had ever a enough for a 1

wormtail  had flipped over a stone and blind a hundred times the thing wormtail 1
had  been  carrying  a crouched human except that harry had never seen anything 1
hairless  and a reddish its arms and legs were thin and and its face child alive 1
ever had a face like that and red the thing seemed almost it raised its thin put 1
them around and wormtail lifted as he did his hood fell and harry pale face in the 2
firelight  as he carried the for one harry saw the flat face illuminated in the 1

voldemort examined it ignoring uis he said will all have noticed and we shall see 2
we shall he pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on the scar on harry s 1
forehead  seared  with a sharp pain and a voldemort removed his fingers from and 1
harry saw that.

path  in  the  forest i had made my very chance i had been dreaming for he was a 1
teacher  at he to bend to my he brought me back to this and his to supervise him 1
closely  as he carried out my but my manage to steal the i was not to be assured 1

the  death  were quite the glittering eyes in their masks fixed upon servant died 1
when i left his and i was left as weak as i returned to my hiding place far and i 2
will not pretend to i fear that i might never regain my that was perhaps my i hope 2
that i would be sent another wizard to and i had my death eaters cared what had 1
become one or two of the masked wizards in the circle.

wormtail who had faked his own to out of hiding by those he had once counted and 1

weak  body  of my a body i inhabit while awaiting the essential ingredients for 1

human  and strong enough was no hope of stealing the stone for i knew that would 1

than i had been when i had i wanted iwanted the blood of the one who had stripped 2
me  of  for  protection  his mother once gave him would then reside how to get at 1
harry  for  he  has  been  better  protected  than  protected in ways devised by 1
dumbledore  long  when  it  fell  to dumbledore invoked an ancient to ensure the 1
protection  as  his  not  even i can touch him of there was the quidditch world i 1
thought  his protection might be weaker away but i was not yet strong enough to 1
attempt  kidnap in of ministry and the boy would return to where he is under the 1
ose  of  that  fool from morning until so how could i using bertha of use my one 1
faithful  stationed  at to ensure that the name was entered into death eater to 1
ensure  that  the  boy won the tournament he first cup which my death eater had 1
turned into a which beyond the reach of help and and into my waiting and here he 1
oy you all believed had been my voldemort moved slowly forward and turned to face 2
he.

raised  it  was pain beyond anything harry had ever his very bones on was surely 1
splitting  along his his eyes were rolling madly black to and then it was he was 1
hanging  limply  in  the ropes binding him looking up into those bright red eyes 1
through  a  kind  of  ringing  with the sound of the death ihow foolish it was to 1
suppose that this boy.

could than said i want there to be no mistake in harry escaped me by a lucky and 1
i am now going to prove my by in front of you when there is no dumbledore to help 2
and  i  will  give  him  his he will be allowed to and you will be is the just a 1
little  he  and the snake glided away grass to where the death eaters untie and 1
give  him  back his hapter priori incantatem wormtail approached who scrambled to 1
find his to support the ropes were wormtail raised his new silver pulled out the 1
agging  and  with  one cut through the bonds tying harry there was a split when 1
harry  might  have considered running injured leg shook under him as he stood on 1
the  overgrown as forming a tighter circle around him and so that the gaps where 1
eath eaters should have stood were wormtail walked out body lay and returned with 2
which  he  thrust roughly into hand without looking at then wormtail resumed his 1
place in the have been taught how to harry said voldemort his red eyes through at 1
these words harry as though from a former the he had attended briefly two years 1
all  he  had  learned there and what use would it be to deprive voldemort of his 1
even  if  he  when  he was surrounded by death outnumbered by at least to learned 1
anything  that  could possibly fit him for he knew he which moody had always the 1
unblockable  avada  kedavra was right mother was not here to die for him this he 1
was  quite  bow to each said bending a but keeping his snakelike face upturned to 1
the  niceties  must be dumbledore would show bow the death eaters were laughing 1
voldemorts lipless mouth he was not going to let voldemort play with him before 1
ive  him  that voldemort raising his wand harry felt his spine curve as invisible 1
hand  were bending him ruthlessly and the death eaters tsaid voldemort and as he 1
raised  his wand the harry lifted now you face like a and the way your ather ow 1
oldemort raised his and before harry could do anything could even he had been hit 2
again  by  the  cruciatus  the  pain that he no longer knew where he knives were 1
piercing  inch  his  his  head  was  surely  going to burst with he was more ever 1
screamed  in  his  life  and  then  it harry rolled over and scrambled to his he 1
uncontrollably as wormtail had done when his hand had.

cut the wall of watching death and they pushed him back little said the nostrils 2
dilating  with little that you want me to do that harry he was going to die like 1
those pitiless red so was going to and there was nothing he could do he going to 1
obey he going to asked you whether you want me to do that said.

voldemort  and harry for the third time in his the sensation of it was not to it 1
was  as  though he were dreaming answer no no answer iwill said a stronger in the 1
back of his i just answer ido i say just.

answer  and these words burst from they echoed through the and state was lifted 1
as suddenly as though cold water had been him aches that the cruciatus curse had 1
left all over his body rushed and what he was said voldemort and the death eaters 1
were not laughing say obedience is a virtue i need to teach you before little dose 2
of  voldemort  raised  his but this time harry was with the of quidditch he flung 1
himself sideways onto the he rolled the headstone of voldemort s and he heard it 1
crack as the curse are not playing said cold as the death eaters cannot hide from 2
does  this mean you of does this mean that you would prefer me to finish it come 1
ut and then will be quick might even be painless would.

not harry crouched behind the headstone and knew the end had there help to be and 2
as  he  heard  voldemort  draw nearer he beyond fear or he was not going to die 1
crouching here a he was not going to die kneeling at voldemort s he was and he was 2
going  to  die  trying to defend even if no was before voldemort could stick his 1
snakelike face around gripped his wand tightly in his thrust it out in front of 1
voldemort was as harry voldemort ajet of green light issued from voldemorts wand 1
just as met in midair suddenly wand was vibrating as though an charge were surging 2
through  his  hand  seized  up  around  he have wanted to a narrow beam of light 1
connected  the  two  deep  following the beam with his astonished saw that white 1
fingers  too  were gripping a wand that was shaking and then could have prepared 1
harry  for  this  felt his feet he and voldemort were both being raised into the 1
their  wands  of shimmering golden they glided away from the tombstone of came to 1
rest on a patch of ground that was clear and.

of  they  were asking voldemort for they were closing reforming the around harry 1
and  the snake slithering at their some wands the golden thread connecting harry 1
and voldemort though the wands athousand more beams arced high over harry and all 2
around  until  they  were  enclosed  in a a cage of beyond which the death eaters 1
circled like.

their voldemort shrieked to the death and harry saw his red eyes astonishment at 1
what  was  saw him fighting to break the his wand with harry held onto his wand 1
more with both and thread remained nothing unless i command voldemort shouted.

to and then an unearthly and beautiful sound filled the it was the web vibrating 2
around harry and it was a sound harry though he had heard it only once before in 1
his  it  was  the sound of hope to the most beautiful and welcome his he felt as 1
though  the  song were inside him instead he connected with and it was almost as 1
though a friend were break the iharry told the i know i but no sooner had he became 2
much  harder  to  his  wand began to vibrate more beam between him and voldemort 1
changed  too  was  as though sliding up and down the thread connecting the wands 1
felt  a  his hand as the light beads began to slide slowly and beams movement was 1
now toward from and he felt his wand as the closest bead of light moved nearer to 2
harrys wand grew so hot he feared it would burst into the closer that wand he was 1
sure  his  wand  would  not  survive  contact with about to shatter under his he 1
concentrated  every  last particle of his mind upon forcing the his ears full of 1
phoenix his eyes and very the beads to a and just as they began to move the other 2
and it wand that was vibrating voldemort who looked and almost one of the beads of 2
light  was inches from the tip of harry understand why he was doing know what it 1
might  but  he  he had never done in his life on forcing that bead of very slowly 1
moved along the golden thread trembled for.

a  at  voldemorts  wand began to emit echoing screams of then eyes widened with 1
shock  smoky hand flew out of the tip of the hand he had made more shouts of and 1
then began to blossom from voldemorts wand a grayish that looked were made of the 2
densest it was a now a chest and the edric if ever harry might have released his 1
wand  from it would kept him clutching his wand so that the thread of though the 1
thick gray ghost of cedric diggory it a it emerged in its entirety from the end 1
of voldemort s as itself out of a very narrow and this shade of cedric.

and the golden thread of and iits voice was distant and harry looked at voldemort 2
wide  shocked  had no more expected this than harry very frightened yells of the 1
death  prowling  around  the  edges  of  more  screams of pain from the and then 1
something  else from dense shadow of a second quickly followed by arms and torso 1
only in a dream was now pushing himself out of the and his or his or whatever it 1
fell next to and surveyed and the golden and the connected with mild leaning on his alking 1
as  a  real  the  old man his eyes on that one you fight but yet another head was 1
emerging this gray as a smoky both arms shaking now as he fought to keep his wand 1
round and straighten up like the the shadow of bertha jorkins surveyed the battle 2
let she and her voice echoed like cedrics as though from let him get harry let she 2
and  the  other  two  shadowy  figures  began to pace the while the death eaters 1
flitted  around the outside of and whispered as they circled the whispered words 1
of words harry hear and now another head was emerging from the tip of and when he 2
saw  it  who  it would be as though he had expected cedric had appeared from the 1
because  the  man appearing of more than any other the smoky shadow of a tall man 1
with untidy hair fell straightened and looked at and his arms shaking madly looked 1
he ghostly face of his he said wants to see you will be all.

hold  and  she  first  her then her a young woman with long shadowy form of lily 1
potter blossomed from the end of to and straightened like her she walked close to 2
spoke  in the same echoing voice as the but so that his face now livid with fear 1
as his victims prowled around could the connection is we will linger for only but 2
we  will  give you must get to the it will return you to hogwarts harry fighting 1
now  to  keep  a hold on his which was and beneath his whispered the figure of my 1
body  will  take  my  body  back  to said his face screwed up with the effort of 1
holding  the it whispered his ready to do it harry he think he could have held on 1
for another pulled his wand upward with an almighty and the golden the the phoenix 2
song died the shadowy figures of victims disappear were closing in upon shielding 2
harry from his gaze and harry ran as he had never run in his knocking.

two  he  zigzagged behind feeling their curses following hearing headstones was 1
dodging  curses  and  pelting  toward  no  the  pain  in  his  his  whole being 1
concentrated on what he had he heard voldemort ten feet from harry dived behind a 1
marble angel to avoid the the tip of its wing shatter as the spells hit gripping 1
his  behind the angel he pointing his wand wildly over his shoulder at the death 1
unning  from a muffled he thought he had stopped at least one stop and he jumped 1
over the cup and dived as he jets of light flew over his head as he stretching out 1
will kill he is shrieked hand had closed one tombstone stood between him and but 2
cedric  was  and  the  cup was out of reach red eyes flamed in the harry saw his 1
mouth  curl into a saw raise his harry pointing his wand at the triwizard it flew 1
into  the air toward harry caught it by the handle he heard voldemort s scream of 1
fury at the same moment that meant the portkey had worked was speeding him away in 1
edric  along  with they were going hapter vharry felt himself slam flat into the 1
his  face was pressed filled his he had closed his eyes while the portkey and he 1
losed he did not all the breath seemed to have been was swimming so badly he felt 2
as  though  the ground beneath to hold himself he tightened his hold on the two 1
cold  handle  of  the  triwizard  cup  and he felt as he away into the blackness 1
gathering  at the edges of his brain if and exhaustion kept him on the breathing 1
in the smell someone to do something to and all the his scar.

burned a torrent of sound deafened and confused there were he remained where he 1
his  face screwed up against the nightmare that then a pair of hands seized him 1
roughly and turned.

him  he  opened  his  he  was  looking up at the starry and albus dumbledore was 1
shadows  of  a crowd of people pressed in around beneath his head reverberating 1
with he had come back to the edge of the he could see the shapes of people moving 2
in  the  stars  harry let go of the but he clutched cedric to him hand and seized 1
while face swam in and out.

words were the shadowy figures pressing in on them it and then others shouted it 1

as  she i put so that he would finish diggory and leave your path harry stared at 1

of three people over moving closer and but watching his magical eye was upon dark 1

here  was  a  blinding  flash of red and with a great and the door of office was 1
blasted  moody was thrown backward onto the office still staring at the face had 1
saw  albus  professor and professor mcgonagall looking back at him out of the he 1
looked  around  and  saw  the  the  dumbledore  in  his  wand at that harry fully 1
understood  for  the first time why only wizard voldemort had ever the look upon 1
face as he at the unconscious form of moody was more terrible than harry there was 2
no benign smile upon no twinkle in the eyes the there was cold fury in every line 2
of  the  ancient  a  sense  of dumbledore as though he were giving off burning he 1
stepped  into  the placed a foot underneath moodys and him over onto his so that 1
his face was snape followed where his own face was still glaring into the professor 1
traight to she the thin line of her mouth was twitching as though she was about to 2
hospital  wing said he ought to at him been through enough will because he needs 1

to  know  who  has put him through the ordeal he has and harry he was still in a 1
state of complete can it.

not  have  removed  you from my sight what the moment he took i knew i dumbledore 1
bent  down over limp form and put a hand inside hip flask and a set of keys on a 1
then he turned.

the called kindly go down where you will find a large black dog sitting in tell 1

revealing different contents each then he the threw open the and harry let out a 1
cry of he was looking down into a kind of an underground and lying feet apparently 2

will  need  to  see  but he seems in no immediate harry did as he was dumbledore 1
covered  moody  in  the  it clambered out of the trunk then he picked up the hip 1
unscrewed  and  turned  it  a  thick  glutinous  liquid  splattered said see the 1
simplicity of and for moody never does drink except from his hip well known of to 2

hen  he  raised  his  wand  once more and ropes flew out of barty binding him he 1
turned  to  professor could i ask you to stand guard here while i take harry said 1
professor  she looked slightly as though she had just watched someone being when 1
she  drew  out her wand and pointed her hand was quite turned to snape tell madam 1
pomfrey to come down we need to get alastor moody into the hospital then go down into 1
ornelius and bring him up to this he will undoubtedly want to tell him i will be 1
in  the  hospital  wing  in half an time snape nodded silently and swept out of 1
dumbledore said harry got up and swayed the pain in his which he had not had been 1
listening to now returned in full he also dumbledore gripped his arm and helped 1
him  out into want you to come up to my office he said quiedy as they is waiting 1
for  harry  a  kind of numbness and a sense of complete unreality did not he was 1
even  glad of he want to have to think about happened since he had first touched 1
the  triwizard he to fresh and sharp as which kept flashing across his inside the 1
slumped  on  the  cradling his stump of an rising from the steaming asking to be 1
returned  his  harry  are  and  are  with  professor  said  his which had been so 1
throughout  the  interrogation of barty shook very head of and knew him they had 1
reached the stone dumbledore gave the it sprang.

and and harry went up the moving spiral staircase to the oak it was standing his 1
face  was white and gaunt as it had been when in one swift he had crossed the are 1
you  all  i  knew it knew something like this his hands shook as he helped harry 1
into  a  he asked more dumbledore began to tell sirius everything barty crouch so 1
tired every bone in his body was he wanted nothing more to for hours and until he 2
fell  asleep  and  have to think there was a soft rush of fawkes the phoenix had 1
left  his  and  landed  on  said  harry  he  stroked  the beautiful fawkes blinked 1
peacefully up at there was something.

about  dumbledore  stopped he sat down opposite behind his he was at who avoided 1
his  dumbledore was going to question he was to harry need to know what happened 1
after you touched the portkey.

in can leave that till said sirius he had put a hand on harrys him have a let him 1
arry  felt a rush of gratitude toward but dumbledore no he leaned forward toward 1
ery  harry  raised  his  head  and  looked into those blue ithought i could help 1
dumbledore said putting you into an sleep and allowing you to postpone the moment 2
when happened i would do but i know numbing the pain for a worse when you finally 2
feel you have shown bravery beyond i of i ask you to demonstrate your courage one 2
more i.

to the phoenix let out one quavering it shivered in the and a drop of hot liquid 1
had slipped down his throat into his.

and  he  took  a  deep  breath and began to tell as he visions passed that night 1
seemed  to  rise  before  his  he  saw  the  had revived he saw the death eaters 1
apparating  between the saw lying on the ground beside the once or sirius made a 1
noise as though about to say his but dumbledore raised his hand to stop and harry 2
was  glad  of  because  it  was  easier  to keep going now he had it was a though 1
something  poisonous  were  being extracted from it was determination he had to 1
keep yet he sensed that once.

he when harry told of wormtail piercing his arm with the let vehement exclamation 2
and dumbledore stood up so quickly that walked around the desk and told harry to 1
stretch out his where his robes were torn and the cut beneath said my blood would 2
make him stronger than if used someone told said the protection my mother left in 2
me have it and he right could touch me without hurting he touched.

my  for  a fleeting harry thought he saw a gleam of something but next harry was 1
sure  he had imagined for when dumbledore had returned to his seat behind the he 1
looked as old as he sitting down has overcome that.

particular  harry  went  he  explained how voldemort had emerged from the and he 1
could  remember of speech to the death then he told how untied returned his wand 1
to and prepared to but when he reached the part where the golden beam of light he 1
found  his  throat  he tried to keep but the memories what had come out of wand 1
were  flooding into his he could see see the old bertha jorkins he was glad when 1
sirius broke wands he looking from harry harry looked up at dumbledore on whose 1
face there was e his eyes gazed into and it was almost as though an beam shot between 1
everse spell said sirius said wand and voldemorts wand share each of them contains 2
a  feather  from  the  tail of the same this pointed at the perching peacefully 1
feather came from said ollivander wrote to tell me you had bought the the moment 1
you left his shop four years what happens when a wand meets its said will not work 2
properly  against each said the owners of the wands force the wands to do battle 1
very  rare  effect one will force the other to regurgitate spells it has the then 1
those  which  preceded he looked interrogatively at and harry said dumbledore his 1
eyes  upon  some form of cedric must have harry came back to said sirius spell can 1
reawaken the said dumbledore that would have is akind of reverse a shadow of the 1
living cedric would.

have  spoke to harry he was suddenly shaking the ghost whatever he said retained 1
appearance and i am guessing other such forms less recent victims of old harry his 2
throat said dumbledore sgrip on shoulder was now so tight it was last murders the 1
wand said reverse more would have of had you maintained the very these these what 1
did they harry described how the figures that had emerged from the.

had  golden  how  voldemort had seemed to fear how the told him what to how had 1
made its final at this harry found he could not he looked around at sirius had his 2
face  in  his harry suddenly became aware that fawkes had left his the had it was 1
resting  its  beautiful head against injured and were falling from its eyes onto 1
the wound left by the the leg was will say it said dumbledore as the phoenix rose 1
into the the perch beside the have shown bravery beyond anything i of you you have 2
shown bravery equal to those who died height of his you have shouldered a grown 1
burden and it you have now given us all we have a right to you will hospital i do 1
not  want  you  returning  to  the dormitory a would you like to stay with sirius 1
nodded  and  stood he transformed back into the harry and dumbledore out of the 1
accompanying  them  down a ospital when dumbledore pushed open the harry saw and 1
grouped around a madam they appeared to be demanding to where harry was and what 1
had  happened to all of them around and the black dog and weasley let out a kind 1
of  muffled h she started to hurry toward but dumbledore moved between he holding 1
up  a listen to me for a harry has through a terrible ordeal he has just had to 1
relive  it and and if he would like you all to stay with he looking and bill may 1
do  but  i  do not want you questioning to and certainly not this weasley she was 1
very she rounded on and bill as though they were being and you he needs said madam 2
staring at the great black dog that was.

i  dog  will  be remaining with harry for a said dumbledore he is extremely well 1
harry will wait while you get into harry felt an inexpressible sense of gratitude 2
to  dumbledore  for question it as though he want them but the thought of it all 1
ver the idea of reliving it one more was more than he will be back to see you as 2
soon as i have met with would like you to remain here tomorrow until i have spoken 1
s madam pomfrey led harry to a nearby he caught sight motionless in a bed at the 2
far  end  of  the  his  wooden leg and edside he be said madam giving harry some 1
pajamas  and  pulling  screens he took off his pulled on the and got into and the 1
black dog came around the screen and settled in of ron and hermione were looking 1
at  him  almost  as  though  all  he  told weasleys eyes filled with tears as she 1
smoothed.

his  madam  who had bustled off to her returned holding a of purple potion and a 1
eed  to  drink all of she a potion for harry took the goblet and drank a few he 1
felt himself everything around him became the lamps around the hospital to him in 2
a  friendly  way  through  the  screen around his deeper into the warmth of the 1
feather  before he could say another his exhaustion had carried him off to harry 1
woke so so very that he open his wanting to the room was still dimly he was sure 2
it was still and have been asleep then he heard whispering around wake him if they 2
shut are they shouting nothing else can have can harry opened his eyes someone had 2
removed his he could see outlines of weasley and bill close weasley was on her she 2
minerva  but  what are they arguing now harry could hear them people shouting and 1
running the but all the minerva cornelius fudge was should never have brought it 1
inside  the  yelled  dumbledore  finds  out harry heard the hospital doors burst 1
unnoticed by any of of whom were staring at the door as bill pulled back ack fudge 2
came  striding  up the professors mcgonagall and snape were fudge demanded of not 1
said  weasley  is  a  hospital  you  do better but the door and dumbledore came 1
sweeping  up  the  has  said  dumbledore  looking from fudge to professor are you 1
disturbing these surprised at you asked you to stand guard over barty crouch is no 2
need to stand guard over him she minister has seen harry had never seen professor 2
mcgonagall lose control like of color in her and a hands were balled into she we 2
told fudge that we had caught the death eater responsible said in a low he seemed 2
to feel his personal safety was summoning a dementor to accompany him into the he 2
barty  crouch  told  him  you would not mcgonagall told him you would never allow 1
dementors to set foot inside the but dear roared who likewise looked angrier than 2
harry  minister  of  it is my decision whether i wish to bring me interviewing a 1
possibly  dangerous but professor voice drowned moment that thing entered the she 1
pointing at trembling all swooped down on crouch.

and harry felt a chill in his stomach as professor what had he did not need her 1
to finish her he knew the have it had administered its fatal kiss to barty it had 2
sucked his he was worse than all he is no blustered seems he has been responsible 1
for.

several  he  cannot  now  give  said he was staring hard at as though seeing him 1
plainly for the first cannot give about killed he killed no is blustered was a raving 1
rom what minerva and severus have told he seems to have all voldemort was giving 1
him dumbledore peoples deaths were mere of a plan to restore voldemort to full the 1
oldemort has been restored to fudge looked as though someone had just swung a he 2
stared back at dumbledore as if he quite believe what began to still goggling at 1
ome minerva and severus have doubtless told said heard barty under the influence 2
of he told us how he was smuggled of and how voldemort of his continued existence 2
from  bertha  to from his father and used him to capture the plan i voldemort to 1
aid  and  harry  was  astonished  to see a slight smile dawning on his seriously 1
believe  that come come crouch may have believed himself to be acting upon but to 1
take the word of a lunatic like dumbledore harry touched the triwizard cup he was 2
transported  to  said dumbledore witnessed lord i will explain it all to you you 1
will  step  up  to dumbledore glanced around at harry and saw that he was but am 1
afraid i cannot permit you to question harry curious smile he too glanced at then 2
looked back at and are to take word on are there was a which was broken by sirius 1
his hackles were and he was baring his teeth i believe said his eyes were blazing 2
and  i  heard  account  of what happened after he two stories make they explain 1
everything  that has happened disappeared last fudge still had that strange smile 1
on his once he.

at  are  prepared  to believe that lord voldemort has on the and a boy fudge shot 1
harry  another and harry been reading rita he said and bill all none of them had 1
realized that harry.

was fudge reddened but a defiant and obstinate look came.

over  if i he looking at i have discovered that been keeping certain facts about 1
the boy very a and having all over the place assume that you are referring to the 1
pains  harry  has admit that he has been having these said fudge ossibly to said 1
taking  a  step  toward  and once he seemed to radiate that indefinable sense of 1
power that stunned young is as sane as you or that scar upon his his i believe it 2
hurts him when lord voldemort is close.

or fudge had taken half a step back from but he looked no forgive but never heard 2
of a curse scar acting as an.

alarm  i  saw voldemort come harry he tried to get out of weasley forced him saw 1
the death i can give you their lucius snape made a sudden but as harry looked at 1
eyes  flew  back  to was said visibly very old family to excellent causes arry now 1
working for.

the are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of thirteen years 1
said  fudge  could  have found those names in old for heavens dumbledore boy was 1
full  of some crackpot year too tales are getting and still swallowing them boy 1
and you still professor mcgonagall these deaths were not the random work of a see 1
no  evidence  to  the  shouted now matching her his seems to me that you are all 1
determined to start a panic have worked for these last harry believe what he was 1
he  had  always  thought  of as alittle a little but essentially but now a angry 1
izard  stood  before  to  accept  the  prospect of disruption in comfortable and 1
ordered  world  believe  that voldemort could has dumbledore you accept that and 1
take  the necessary we may still be able to save the essential step is to remove 1
azkaban  from  the  control of the shouted fudge the be kicked out of office for 1
uggesting half of us only feel safe in our beds at we standing guard at rest of us 2
sleep less soundly in our knowing that you most dangerous supporters in the care 1
of creatures who will join asks said will not remain loyal to voldemort can them 1
much  more  scope  for  their  powers  and  their  pleasures  behind and his old 1
supporters  returned to you will be regaining the sort of power he had thirteen 1
fudge was opening and closing his mouth as though.

no  second  step  you  must  take at dumbledore pressed to send to tto the fudge 1
finding  his  tongue madness is them the hand of before it is too voldemort will 1
persuade  as  he  did  that  he alone among will rights and their cannot be fudge 1
shaking his head and retreating further from the magical community got wind that 1
i  had  approached dumbledore of my are said his voice rising the aura of power 1
around him his eyes blazing once the love of the office you you place too much and 2
you  always have on the purity of you recognize that it matters not what someone 1
is  but what they just destroyed the last remaining member of a family as old man 1
chose  to  make  of  his i tell you nowtake the steps in office or as one of the 1
bravest and greatest ministers fail to act history will remember you as the man who 1
oldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have to whispered still backing 1
nd  then there was madam pomfrey was standing frozen her hands over her weasley 1
was still standing over her to prevent him from and hermione were staring at your 1
determination to shut your eyes will carry you as have reached a parting of the 1
you  must act as you act as i voice carried no hint of a it sounded like a mere 1
bristled  as  though  dumbledore  were  advancing  upon  him  see  he  waving a 1
threatening given you free had a lot of respect for i might not have agreed with 1
ept  there  many have let you hire or keep or decide what to teach your students 1
without reference to the.

but only one against whom i intend to said lord if are against then we on the same 1
t seemed fudge could think of no answer to he rocked and small feet for a moment 1
and  spun  his  bowler  hat in his he plea in his be he just be snape strode past 1
pulling  up  the left sleeve of his robes stuck out his forearm and showed it to 1
said  snape the dark it is not as clear as it was an hour when it burned but you 1
can still see every death eater by the dark it was a means of distinguishing one 2
and  his  of  to when he touched the mark of any death we were to and at his this 1
mark  has been growing clearer all karkaroff s think karkaroff fled we both felt 1
the  mark  we  both knew karkaroff fears the dark he betrayed too many of his be 1
sure of a welcome back into fudge stepped back from snape he was shaking his he did 1
n  a  word snape had he apparently repelled by the ugly looked up at dumbledore 1
and know what you and.

your but i have heard i have no more to i will be in with to discuss the running 1
of  this  i  must return to the he had almost reached the door when he he turned 1
strode  and  stopped  he said taking a large bag of gold out of his pocket onto 1
harrys  bedside  thousand  there  should have been a but under the he crammed his 1
bowler  hat  onto his head and walked out of behind the moment he had dumbledore 1
turned to look at.

was  white  to  the but she looked know what fudge fondness for muggles that has 1
held  him back ministry all these fudge thinks he lacks proper i need to send a 1

i am at the ministry it to he clapped a hand on kissed his mother on the pulled on 1
nd strode quickly from the said turning to professor want to see hagrid in office 2
as  soon  as  also she will consent to come professor mcgonagall nodded and left 1
without a dumbledore said to madam you be very kind and go down professor moodys 1
where i think you will find a called winky do what you can for and take her back 1
to the i think her for said madam looking and she too dumbledore made sure that the 2
door was and that madam footsteps before he spoke he is time for two of our number 2
to  recognize  each  for  sirius  you could resume your usual the great black dog 1
looked  up  at  in  an  turned back weasley screamed and leapt back from the she 1
pointing at shut snape had not yelled or jumped but the look on his nd he staring 1
at whose face showed equal is he.

lay aside your old and harry thought dumbledore was asking for a near sirius and snape 1
ther with the utmost will in the short said with a bite of impatience in.

his lack of open you will shake you are on the same side unless the few of us who 2
know the truth do not stand there for any very slowly still glaring at each other 2
as  though each the sirius and snape moved toward each other and shook they will 1

looked  slightly  paler than and his black eyes good said and he with a trace of 1
apprehension on his as snape swept wordlessly after it was several minutes before 1

arry slumped back against his pillows as dumbledore and weasley were all looking 1
at none of them spoke for a got to take the rest of your weasley said at her hand 1

on the bedside bent and put he had no memory of ever being hugged like as though 2
by  of  everything he had seen that night seemed to fall in his mother s his the 1

at  he that they leave harry that nobody ask him questions or badger had happened 1
in the most he were skirting him in the avoiding his some whispered behind their 1
hands  as  he  he  guessed  that  believed  rita article about how disturbed and 1
possibly  dangerous  were  formulating their own theories about how cedric had he 1
liked it best when he was with ron and hermione and they or else letting him sit 1
in  silence  while they played he them had reached an understanding they need to 1
put into was some some of what was going on outside hogwarts that speculate about 2
what  might  be coming until they knew for touched upon the subject was when ron 1
told  harry  about  dumbledore  before  going  went  to ask him if you could come 1
straight to us you to go back to the at least at aid said got his said shaking his 2

with a heavy heart that harry packed his trunk up in his return to privet he was 2
dreading the leaving which a when the winner of the championship would be he had 1
voided being in the great hall when it was full ever since preferring to eat when 2
it  was nearly empty to avoid the when and hermione entered the they saw at once 1
that the usual were the great hall was normally decorated with the winning leaving 2
there  were  black  drapes on the wall behind the harry knew instantly that they 1
